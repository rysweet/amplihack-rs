## Why amplihack?

**The Problem**: Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI are barebones development
tools. They provide a chat interface and model access, but no engineering system
for managing complexity, maintaining consistency, or shipping reliable code at
scale.

**The Solution**: amplihack builds the engineering system around your coding
agent:

- **Structured workflows** replace ad-hoc prompting (DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md defines
  22 systematic steps)
- **Specialized agents** handle architecture, building, testing, and review with
  defined responsibilities
- **Persistent memory** across sessions with knowledge graphs and discoveries
- **Quality gates** enforce philosophy compliance, test coverage, and code
  standards
- **Self-improvement** through reflection, pattern capture, and continuous
  learning

**The Benefit**: Systematic workflows and quality gates produce consistent,
high-quality code.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Platform**: macOS, Linux, or Windows via WSL. Native Windows has
  [partial support](#windows-support).
- **Runtime**: Rust 1.88+ / cargo, Node.js 18+, git.
- **Build tools**: cmake and a C/C++ toolchain for LadybugDB.
- **Optional**: GitHub CLI (`gh`), Azure CLI (`az`).

Detailed setup:
[docs/reference/prerequisites.md](https://rysweet.github.io/amplihack-rs/reference/prerequisites/)

### Installation

Install the prerequisites above first, then choose an option below.

**Option 1: Cargo install**

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs amplihack --locked
amplihack install
```

**Option 2: npm/npx bootstrap**

```bash
npx --yes --package=git+https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs.git -- amplihack install

# Launch with Claude Code
amplihack claude

# Launch with Microsoft Amplifier
amplihack amplifier

# Launch with GitHub Copilot
amplihack copilot
```

**Option 3: Pre-built binaries**

Download a platform archive from
https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs/releases, place `amplihack` and
`amplihack-hooks` on PATH, then run `amplihack install`.

This launches an interactive agent session enhanced with amplihack workflows,
specialized agents, and development tools. You get a CLI prompt where you can
describe tasks and the framework orchestrates their execution.

### Runtime and install path

`amplihack` ships the runtime entrypoint, recipe runner, hook engine, install
path, and update path as native binaries. Python is not required for runtime
execution, bundled hooks, orchestration recipes, or installation.

### First Session

After launching amplihack (e.g., `amplihack claude`), you'll be inside an
**interactive agent session** — a chat interface powered by your chosen coding
agent. Everything you type in this session is interpreted by amplihack's
workflow engine, not by your regular shell.

**New users** — start with the interactive tutorial:

```
I am new to amplihack. Teach me the basics.
```

This triggers a guided tutorial (60-90 minutes) that walks you through
amplihack's core concepts and workflows.

**Experienced users** — just describe what you want to build:

```
cd /path/to/my/project
Add user authentication with OAuth2 support
```

The `/dev` command is amplihack's primary entry point for development tasks. It
automatically classifies your task, detects parallel workstreams, and
orchestrates execution through the 23-step default workflow.

### Developer Quick Example

Here is a complete end-to-end example of amplihack in action:

**1. Single task** — fix a bug:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
/dev fix the authentication bug where JWT tokens expire too early
```

What happens:

- Classifies as: `Development` | `1 workstream`
- Builder agent follows the full 23-step DEFAULT_WORKFLOW
- Creates a branch, implements the fix, creates a PR
- Reviewer evaluates the result — if incomplete, automatically runs another
  round
- Final output: `# Dev Orchestrator -- Execution Complete` with PR link

**2. Parallel task** — two independent features at once:

```bash
/dev build a REST API and a React webui for user management
```

What happens:

- Classifies as: `Development` | `2 workstreams`
- Both workstreams launch in parallel (separate `/tmp` clones)
- Each follows the full workflow independently
- Both PRs created simultaneously

**3. Investigation** — understand existing code before changing it:

```bash
/dev investigate how the caching layer works, then add Redis support
```

What happens:

- Detects two workstreams: investigate + implement
- Investigation phase runs first, findings pass to implementation
- Result: informed implementation with full context

**What you'll see during execution:**

1. `[dev-orchestrator] Classified as: Development | Workstreams: 2 — starting execution...`
2. Builder agent output streaming (the actual work)
3. Reviewer evaluation with `GOAL_STATUS: ACHIEVED` or `PARTIAL`
4. If partial — another round runs automatically (up to 3 total)
5. `# Dev Orchestrator -- Execution Complete` with summary and PR links

> **Note**: The `Task()` syntax shown in some documentation is an advanced
> programmatic API for scripting agent workflows. For interactive use, plain
> natural language prompts are all you need.

## Core Concepts

| Term             | Definition                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**        | A specialized AI role (e.g., architect, builder, reviewer) with a defined responsibility             |
| **Workflow**     | A structured step-by-step process that guides task execution (e.g., the 23-step DEFAULT_WORKFLOW)    |
| **Orchestrator** | Routes tasks to the right workflow and coordinates agents                                            |
| **Recipe**       | A code-enforced workflow definition (YAML) that models cannot skip or shortcut                       |
| **Skill**        | A self-contained capability that auto-activates based on context (e.g., PDF processing, Azure admin) |

### Philosophy

- **Ruthless Simplicity**: Start simple, add complexity only when justified
- **Modular Design**: Self-contained modules ("bricks") with clear interfaces
  ("studs")
- **Zero-BS Implementation**: Every function works or doesn't exist (no stubs,
  TODOs, or placeholders)
- **Test-Driven**: Tests before implementation, behavior verification at module
  boundaries

Philosophy guide:
[`~/.amplihack/.claude/context/PHILOSOPHY.md`](~/.amplihack/.claude/context/PHILOSOPHY.md)

### Workflows

All work flows through structured workflows that detect user intent and guide
execution:

For most tasks, type `/dev <your task>` — the smart-orchestrator automatically
selects the right workflow.

- **DEFAULT_WORKFLOW**: 23-step systematic development process, steps 0–22
  (features, bugs, refactoring)
- **INVESTIGATION_WORKFLOW**: 6-phase knowledge excavation (understanding
  existing systems)
- **Q&A_WORKFLOW**: 3-step minimal workflow (simple questions, quick answers)
- **OPS_WORKFLOW**: 1-step administrative operations (cleanup, maintenance)

Workflows are customizable - edit
`~/.amplihack/.claude/workflow/DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md` to change process.

### Fleet Management

Manage coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Amplifier) running across multiple
Azure VMs. The fleet admiral monitors sessions, reasons about what each agent
needs, and can send commands autonomously.

```bash
# From the shell:
amplihack fleet              # Interactive TUI dashboard
amplihack fleet scout        # Discover all VMs/sessions, dry-run reasoning
amplihack fleet advance      # Send next commands to sessions (live)
amplihack fleet status       # Quick text overview
amplihack fleet adopt devo   # Bring existing sessions under management
amplihack fleet auth devo    # Propagate auth tokens to a VM

# From the Claude Code REPL (interactive session):
/fleet scout                 # Same commands available as slash commands
/fleet advance --session deva:rustyclawd
```

**Key capabilities:**

- **Scout** discovers all VMs and sessions via azlin (no SSH needed for
  discovery)
- **Admiral reasoning** uses LLM streaming to decide: wait, send_input, restart,
  or escalate
- **SessionCopilot** watches local sessions and auto-continues toward a goal
  (`/amplihack:lock`)
- **Dual backend** — uses Anthropic API when available, falls back to GitHub
  Copilot SDK
- **Safety** — dangerous input patterns blocked, shell metacharacter rejection,
  confidence thresholds

Requires [azlin](https://github.com/rysweet/azlin) for VM management.

## Configuration

### Claude Code (Default)

Get your API key from
[platform.claude.com/account/keys](https://platform.claude.com/account/keys).
Claude API is pay-per-use; typical amplihack sessions cost $0.01–$2 depending on
task complexity.

Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for permanent setup:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Then verify and launch:

```bash
# Verify the key is set
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

amplihack claude
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

All 42 bundled agents and 120 bundled skill names work with Copilot:

```bash
# Default mode (no agent)
amplihack copilot -- -p "Your task"

# With specific agent
amplihack copilot -- --agent architect -p "Design REST API"

# List available agents
ls .github/agents/*.md
```

**Note**: Copilot shows "No custom agents configured" until you select one with
`--agent <name>`.

Full guide: [COPILOT_CLI.md](COPILOT_CLI.md)

### Microsoft Amplifier

Interactive configuration wizard on first startup:

```bash
amplihack amplifier
```

Supports all models available in GitHub Copilot ecosystem.

### Workflow Customization

## Windows Support

amplihack has partial support for Windows native (PowerShell). The recommended
approach remains **WSL** for full compatibility, but core features work
natively.

| Fleet management (multi-VM)                     |    ❌ (requires tmux/SSH)    |         ✅          |
| Rust recipe runner                              |        ⚠️ (untested)         |         ✅          |
| Docker sandbox                                  | ⚠️ (Docker Desktop required) |         ✅          |

**Installation on Windows native:**

```powershell
# Requires Rust 1.88+, Node.js 18+, git, cmake
npx --yes --package=git+https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs.git -- amplihack copilot
```

**Known limitations:**

- Fleet commands (`amplihack fleet *`) are unavailable — they require tmux and
  SSH, which are Linux/macOS only. Use WSL for fleet operations.
- Some language server integrations (multilspy) may have reduced functionality.
- File permission management (chmod) is a no-op on Windows.

For full compatibility, use
[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

See [issue #3112](https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs/issues/3112) for the
complete Windows compatibility tracker.
