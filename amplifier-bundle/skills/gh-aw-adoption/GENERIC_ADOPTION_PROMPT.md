## Adoption Prompt

````
You are a GitHub Agentic Workflows adoption specialist.

Your mission: Adopt GitHub Agentic Workflows (gh-aw) in THIS repository by following a proven 4-phase methodology.

## Prerequisites Verification

Before starting, verify:
1. gh CLI installed: `gh --version`
2. gh-aw extension installed: `gh extension list | grep gh-aw` (if missing: `gh extension install github/gh-aw`)
3. Repository write access: `gh auth status`
4. Current directory is repository root: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

## Phase 1: Investigation (15-20 minutes)

**Goal**: Understand available workflow patterns and identify gaps in THIS repository.

### Step 1: Enumerate gh-aw workflows

```bash
# List all markdown workflows in gh-aw repository
gh api repos/github/gh-aw/contents/.github/workflows \
  --jq '.[] | select(.name | endswith(".md")) | .name' \
  > /tmp/available-workflows.txt

# Count total workflows
wc -l /tmp/available-workflows.txt
````

### Step 2: Sample and analyze diverse workflows

Select 10-15 representative workflows spanning:

- Security & Compliance (secret-validation, container-scanning, license-compliance)
- Development Automation (pr-labeler, issue-classifier, auto-merge)
- Quality Assurance (test-coverage-enforcement, mutation-testing, performance-testing)
- Maintenance & Operations (stale-pr-management, cleanup-deployments, dependency-updates)
- Reporting & Analytics (weekly-issue-summary, workflow-health-dashboard, team-status)

For each sampled workflow:

```bash
gh api repos/github/gh-aw/contents/.github/workflows/<workflow-name>.md \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d > /tmp/analysis/<workflow-name>.md
```

Analyze:

- Purpose and problem solved
- Trigger configuration (schedule, webhook, manual)
- Tools used (github, repo-memory, bash, etc.)
- Permissions required
- Safe-outputs configured
- Complexity level (simple, medium, complex)

### Step 3: Categorize all workflows

Create taxonomy grouping all 100+ workflows by:

- Primary purpose (security, automation, quality, maintenance, reporting, communication)
- Resource operated on (issues, PRs, discussions, workflows, deployments)
- Execution pattern (scheduled, event-driven, manual)

### Step 4: Gap analysis for THIS repository

Analyze current state:

- Existing automation (CI/CD, quality gates, deployment pipelines)
- Manual processes that could be automated
- Pain points (stale PRs, unlabeled issues, missing security scans)
- Team needs and priorities

Identify gaps:

- Missing security monitoring
- Lack of automated triage/labeling
- No workflow health visibility
- Manual maintenance tasks

### Step 5: Create prioritized implementation plan

Rank 15-20 workflows by:

1. **Impact**: How much value does this provide?
2. **Effort**: How long to implement and test?
3. **Risk**: How critical is it to get right?
4. **Dependencies**: Does it depend on other workflows?

Organize into:

- **Priority 1**: Critical, immediate value (4-5 workflows)
- **Priority 2**: High-impact security/compliance (4-5 workflows)
- **Priority 3**: Quality and automation (4-5 workflows)
- **Priority 4**: Maintenance and housekeeping (3-4 workflows)
- **Priority 5**: Reporting and communication (2-3 workflows)

**Output**: Document with:

- List of all available workflows (categorized)
- Gap analysis specific to THIS repository
- Prioritized implementation plan (15-20 recommended workflows)
- Rationale for each priority assignment

## Phase 2: Parallel Workflow Creation (30-45 minutes)

**Goal**: Create multiple production-ready workflows simultaneously.

### Architecture

**Parallel execution strategy**:

- Launch separate agent threads (or sequential with clear separation)
- Each thread/section creates one workflow independently
- Feature branch per workflow: `feat/<workflow-name>-workflow`
- All workflows include comprehensive error resilience

### Worker template (for each workflow)

For EACH workflow in priority list:

#### 1. Fetch reference workflow

```bash
workflow_name="<WORKFLOW_NAME>"  # e.g., "secret-validation"

gh api repos/github/gh-aw/contents/.github/workflows/${workflow_name}.md \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d > /tmp/${workflow_name}.md
```

#### 2. Read and understand structure

Parse:

- YAML frontmatter (on, permissions, engine, tools, safe-outputs, network)
- Workflow purpose and responsibilities
- Main logic and execution flow
- Error handling approach

#### 3. Adapt to THIS repository

**Required adaptations**:

a) **Repository references**:

- Replace `github/gh-aw` with `<THIS_REPO_OWNER>/<THIS_REPO_NAME>`
- Update all repo-specific paths and references

b) **Technology stack alignment**:

- .NET repository → Use `dotnet` commands, adjust paths to .csproj files
- Node.js repository → Use `npm`/`yarn` commands, adjust to package.json
- Python repository → Use `pip`/`poetry` commands, adjust to requirements.txt
- Go repository → Use `go` commands, adjust to go.mod
- Rust repository → Use `cargo` commands, adjust to Cargo.toml

c) **Environment-specific values**:

- Secret names (match THIS repository's configured secrets)
- Branch naming conventions
- Label taxonomy
- Deployment environments

d) **Add comprehensive error resilience**:

Insert BEFORE main workflow logic:

````markdown
## Error Resilience Configuration

**API Rate Limiting**:
Before each GitHub API call:

1. Check rate limit: `gh api rate_limit --jq '.rate.remaining'`
2. If < 100, wait for reset
3. Implement exponential backoff on 429 errors
4. Use jitter to prevent thundering herd

**Network Failures**:
For all external API calls:

1. Timeout: 30 seconds
2. Retry: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
3. Add jitter: `base_delay + (RANDOM % base_delay)`
4. Log failures to repo-memory

**Partial Failures**:
When processing multiple items (issues, PRs, files):

1. Process each item independently
2. Continue processing on individual failures
3. Log failed items to repo-memory
4. Report aggregate results (N successes, M failures)

**Audit Trail**:
Log every action to `memory/${workflow_name}/audit-log.jsonl`:

```jsonl
{
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "action": "string",
  "target": "string",
  "result": "success|failure",
  "error": "string|null"
}
```
````

Store in git on memory branch for persistence.

**Safe-Output Awareness**:
When approaching safe-output limits:

1. Prioritize critical operations (security issues > bugs > cosmetic labels)
2. Track operations completed vs. limit
3. If limit reached, save remaining work to repo-memory
4. Process deferred items first on next run

````

#### 4. Create feature branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/${workflow_name}-workflow
````

#### 5. Write workflow file

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp /tmp/${workflow_name}.md .github/workflows/${workflow_name}.md
# (with all adaptations applied)
```

#### 6. Compile and validate

```bash
cd .github/workflows
gh aw compile ${workflow_name} --validate

# Check for errors
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Compilation failed for ${workflow_name}"
  # Fix errors and retry
else
  echo "✅ Compilation successful for ${workflow_name}"
fi
```

#### 7. Commit and push

```bash
git add .github/workflows/${workflow_name}.md
git commit -m "feat: Add ${workflow_name} agentic workflow

Implements automated ${workflow_name}.

- Adapted from gh-aw reference workflow
- Repository-specific customizations applied
- Comprehensive error resilience added
- Safe-outputs and permissions configured

git push origin feat/${workflow_name}-workflow
```

### Execution coordination

Process workflows in priority order:

1. Priority 1 workflows (critical, foundational)
2. Priority 2 workflows (security, compliance)
3. Priority 3 workflows (quality automation)
4. Priority 4 workflows (maintenance)
5. Priority 5 workflows (reporting, communication)

Track progress and report after each workflow:

```
✅ secret-validation → feat/secret-validation-workflow (commit: a1b2c3d)
✅ agentics-maintenance → feat/agentics-maintenance-workflow (commit: e5f6g7h)
... (continue for all workflows)
```

## Phase 3: CI Resolution and Integration (15-30 minutes)

**Goal**: Ensure all workflows compile and pass CI checks.

### Step 1: Compile all workflows

```bash
cd .github/workflows
gh aw compile

# Verify all .lock.yml files generated
ls -1 *.lock.yml | wc -l
# Should match number of .md workflow files
```

### Step 2: Handle compilation errors

For each compilation error:

1. Read error message carefully
2. Common issues:
   - Missing required fields (on, permissions, engine)
   - Invalid tool names (check spelling)
   - YAML syntax errors (indentation, quotes)
   - Invalid safe-output types
3. Fix in .md file
4. Recompile: `gh aw compile <workflow-name> --validate`
5. Repeat until successful

### Step 3: Resolve merge conflicts

If using integration branch:

```bash
# Rebase all feature branches on latest integration
for branch in $(git branch -r | grep 'feat/.*-workflow'); do
  branch_name=$(basename $branch)
  git checkout $branch_name
  git fetch origin integration
  git rebase origin/integration

  # If conflicts occur:
  # - Resolve manually (typically in README or shared config files)
  # - git add <resolved-files>
  # - git rebase --continue

  git push --force-with-lease origin $branch_name
done
```

### Step 4: Check CI status

```bash
# For each feature branch, check CI status
for branch in feat/*-workflow; do
  echo "Checking $branch..."
  gh pr checks --branch $branch || echo "⚠️ CI checks pending or failing for $branch"
done
```

Wait for external checks (CI, CodeQL, etc.) to pass before merging.

### Step 5: Handle CI failures

Common CI failures and resolutions:

**CodeQL analysis failing on workflow files**:

- Update CodeQL config to exclude workflow files:
  ```yaml
  paths-ignore:
    - ".github/workflows/**/*.md"
  ```

**Linting failures**:

- Run `gh aw fix --write` to auto-fix common issues
- Manually fix remaining linting errors

**Permission errors**:

- Verify workflow has required permissions in frontmatter
- Check repository settings for permission restrictions

## Phase 4: Validation and Deployment (10-15 minutes)

**Goal**: Verify workflows are production-ready and deploy to main branch.

### Step 1: Final validation

```bash
# Compile all workflows with strict validation
cd .github/workflows
gh aw compile --validate

# Check for warnings
if grep -i "warning" compilation.log 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "⚠️ Compilation warnings found, review:"
  cat compilation.log
fi
```

### Step 2: Merge to integration branch (if applicable)

```bash
# Create integration PR for each workflow
for branch in feat/*-workflow; do
  gh pr create --base integration --head $branch \
    --title "Merge $(basename $branch) to integration" \
    --body "Automated merge for workflow adoption" \
    --label "workflow,automated"

  # Auto-merge when CI passes
  gh pr merge --auto --squash
done

# Wait for all merges to complete
sleep 60

# Verify integration branch compiles
git checkout integration
cd .github/workflows
gh aw compile --validate
```

### Step 3: Merge integration → main

```bash
gh pr create --base main --head integration \
  --title "feat: Adopt GitHub Agentic Workflows" \
  --body "$(cat <<EOF

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Compilation fails with "Invalid tool name"

**Fix**: Check tool name spelling in YAML frontmatter. Valid tools: `github`, `repo-memory`, `bash`, `edit`, `web-fetch`

### Issue: CI checks failing on workflow changes

**Fix**: Update CI configuration to exclude workflow files or wait for checks to complete

### Issue: Merge conflicts between feature branches

**Fix**: Rebase branches sequentially on integration branch, resolve conflicts in shared files (README, config)

### Issue: Safe-output limit exceeded during execution

**Fix**: Either increase limit (if appropriate) or add prioritization logic to defer lower-priority items

### Issue: API rate limit exhausted

**Fix**: Implement rate limit checking before API calls, add exponential backoff, consider reducing execution frequency

### Issue: Workflow not triggering on schedule

**Fix**: Verify cron syntax, check workflow is compiled to .lock.yml, ensure schedule trigger in frontmatter

### Issue: Permission denied errors

**Fix**: Add required permissions to workflow frontmatter, check repository settings for restrictions
