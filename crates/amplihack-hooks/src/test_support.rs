//! Shared test utilities for amplihack-hooks unit tests.
//!
//! Provides a process-wide environment lock (`env_lock`) that must be held
//! by any test that reads or writes process environment variables (HOME, PATH,
//! AMPLIHACK_*, etc.).  Using a single shared lock across all test modules in
//! this binary prevents races when cargo runs tests in parallel.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[test]
//! fn my_env_test() {
//!     let _guard = crate::test_support::env_lock()
//!         .lock()
//!         .unwrap_or_else(|p| p.into_inner());
//!     // … modify/read env vars safely …
//! }
//! ```

use std::sync::{Mutex, OnceLock};

/// Returns a reference to the process-wide environment lock.
///
/// All tests in this binary that mutate process environment variables
/// (HOME, PATH, AMPLIHACK_*, etc.) must hold this lock for the duration
/// of the mutation to prevent races in parallel test execution.
pub(crate) fn env_lock() -> &'static Mutex<()> {
