## Cleanup Agent Gap: Root Directory Organization (2026-01-12)

### Issue

Root directory accumulated documentation files that belonged in `docs/` subdirectories. Files like `EVALUATION_SUMMARY.md` and `gh_pages_link_validation.txt` cluttered the root when they should be organized by category.

### Root Cause

1. **Cleanup agent scope limitation**: The cleanup agent focuses on code quality (dead code, complexity) but doesn't enforce documentation organization
2. **No proactive file placement checking**: No automated check for misplaced documentation in root
3. **Unclear guidelines**: File organization guidelines existed but weren't centralized or easily discoverable
4. **No prevention mechanism**: Nothing stops documentation from being created in root

### Solution

**Three-part documentation system:**

1. **File Organization Guidelines** (`docs/contributing/file-organization.md`):
   - Clear decision tree fer file placement
   - Examples of proper organization
   - Integration with cleanup agent (future)

2. **Archive Directory Structure** (`archive/legacy/README.md`):
   - Standard location fer superseded files
   - Clear policy on what goes there
   - Example: `setup.py` archived when superseded by `pyproject.toml`

3. **Moved Misplaced Files**:
   - `EVALUATION_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/memory/evaluation-summary.md`
   - `gh_pages_link_validation.txt` → `docs/testing/gh-pages-link-validation.txt`
   - `setup.py` → `archive/legacy/setup.py`

### Key Learnings

1. **Cleanup spans more than code**: File organization and documentation structure matter fer discoverability
2. **Guidelines need centralization**: Scattered advice in multiple docs isn't enforced
3. **Prevention better than cleanup**: Catch misplaced files before they be committed
4. **Archive preserves history**: Don't delete superseded files if they might have reference value

### Prevention

- Create `docs/contributing/file-organization.md` with clear guidelines (✅ done)
- Update cleanup agent to suggest documentation moves (tracked as enhancement)
- Add pre-commit hook to flag documentation files in root (future)
- Reference file organization guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Use `make check-broken-links` after movin' files to verify references

### Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Cleanup Agent Extension**: Add documentation organization to cleanup agent responsibilities
2. **Pre-commit Check**: Warn when documentation be created outside `docs/`
3. **Link Validation**: Automatically update and validate internal links when movin' files
4. **Documentation Index**: Keep `docs/index.md` automatically updated with new files

## Workflow Enforcement via CLAUDE.md (2025-11-26)

### Issue

Claude consistently ignored workflow instructions even when explicitly invoked with `/ultrathink`. Despite the command being explicitly invoked, Claude would skip workflow steps or not follow the DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md at all.

### Root Cause

**4 levels of indirection** caused context loss:

```
/ultrathink command
  -> ultrathink-orchestrator skill
    -> default-workflow skill
      -> DEFAULT_WORKFLOW.md
```

Each layer of indirection loses context. By the time Claude reaches the actual workflow file, the instruction to follow it strictly has been diluted or lost.

### Solution

**PR #1686** eliminated the indirection by adding workflow classification directly to CLAUDE.md:

1. Added "MANDATORY: Workflow Selection" section to CLAUDE.md (lines 19-64)
2. Created Q&A_WORKFLOW.md for simple questions (enables "always use a workflow")
3. Deprecated (but kept working) the old command/skill chain
4. Removed all /ultrathink references from CLAUDE.md

### Classification Table

| Task Type     | Workflow               | When to Use                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Q&A           | Q&A_WORKFLOW           | Simple questions, single-turn answers |
| Investigation | INVESTIGATION_WORKFLOW | Understanding code, research          |
| Development   | DEFAULT_WORKFLOW       | Code changes, features, bugs          |

### Key Learnings

1. **Indirection kills enforcement**: Each layer between instruction and action reduces compliance
2. **Put critical instructions in CLAUDE.md**: It's always loaded, always visible
3. **Create exhaustive categories**: Q&A_WORKFLOW enables "always use a workflow" without exception
4. **Deprecate gracefully**: Keep old commands working but direct to new pattern

### Prevention

- Put mandatory behavior directly in CLAUDE.md, not in commands/skills
- Limit indirection to 1 level maximum for critical instructions
- Create a workflow for every task category to enable "no exceptions" rules
- Test workflow enforcement by starting fresh sessions

## Auto Mode SDK Integration Challenges (2025-10-25)

### Issue

Auto mode integration with Claude Code SDK had multiple failure modes including session fork crashes, missing UI flags, and test enforcement not respecting auto mode context.

### Root Cause

1. **Session management complexity**: Multiple approaches (SDK fork, environment variable export, process spawning) created confusion
2. **Flag inconsistency**: --ui flag was removed in some code paths but not others
3. **Test enforcement blindness**: Test enforcement system didn't check for auto mode before failing on missing tests
4. **PID exposure**: Security violation from exposing process IDs in auto mode output

### Solution

**Issue #1013 resolution** implemented hybrid session management:

```python
# Hybrid approach: SDK fork for subprocess + environment variable export
session_data = self._sdk.export_for_subprocess()
os.environ["CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID"] = session_data["session_id"]
# Fork SDK session for subprocess
fork_output = fork_manager.create_fork(session_id)
```

**Test enforcement** updated to respect auto mode:

```python
# Check if running in auto mode before enforcing tests
if not is_auto_mode():
    enforce_test_requirements()
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Hybrid session management works best**: SDK fork for subprocess control + environment export for persistence
2. **Auto mode needs special handling**: Many validation gates should be bypassed or adapted for auto mode
3. **Security first**: Never expose process IDs or system internals in user-facing output
4. **Test with the actual SDK**: Mock testing misses critical integration issues

### Prevention

- Always check `is_auto_mode()` before enforcing validation gates
- Use hybrid session management for subprocess creation
- Never expose PIDs, absolute paths, or system internals
- Test auto mode flows with real Claude SDK, not mocks

## Azure OpenAI Proxy Port Binding Failures (2025-10-24)

### Issue

Proxy failed to start with port already in use errors, causing sessions to hang indefinitely waiting for proxy health check.

### Root Cause

1. **Port persistence**: Proxy process crashed but port remained bound to dead process
2. **No port cleanup**: No mechanism to detect and clean up stale port bindings
3. **No timeout**: Health check waited forever for proxy that would never start
4. **Silent failure**: No clear error message about what went wrong

### Solution

**Dynamic port selection** with retry:

```python
# Try binding to requested port, fall back to dynamic port if busy
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        # Try binding to check availability
        test_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        test_socket.bind(("127.0.0.1", port))
        test_socket.close()
        return port
    except OSError:
        # Port busy, try next port
        port += 1
```

**Health check timeout**:

```python
# Don't wait forever for proxy
health_check_timeout = 30  # seconds
if not wait_for_proxy_health(timeout=health_check_timeout):
    raise ProxyStartupError("Proxy failed to start within timeout")
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Always implement timeouts**: Never wait indefinitely for external processes
2. **Dynamic port selection prevents conflicts**: Especially important for dev environments
3. **Fail fast and loud**: Clear error messages save hours of debugging
4. **Clean up process state**: Dead processes can hold resources

### Prevention

- Implement dynamic port selection for all network services
- Always set timeouts on health checks and startup waits
- Add cleanup logic for stale processes and port bindings
- Log clear error messages with actionable guidance

## Hook Execution Permissions and Path Handling (2025-10-20)

### Issue

User-provided hooks failed silently or with cryptic errors. Common failure modes:

- Hooks without execute permissions
- Relative paths in hook configuration
- Hooks timing out without clear feedback

### Root Cause

1. **No permission checking**: System didn't verify hooks were executable before attempting to run them
2. **Relative path confusion**: Hooks specified with relative paths failed when run from different directories
3. **Silent timeouts**: Hooks timing out produced no clear error message
4. **Inconsistent execution context**: Hooks ran from various working directories

### Solution

**Hook validation at installation time**:

```python
def validate_hook(hook_path: Path) -> None:
    if not hook_path.exists():
        raise HookValidationError(f"Hook does not exist: {hook_path}")
    if not os.access(hook_path, os.X_OK):
        # Try to add execute permission
        hook_path.chmod(hook_path.stat().st_mode | 0o111)
        logger.info(f"Added execute permission to hook: {hook_path}")
    # Convert to absolute path
    hook_path = hook_path.resolve()
```

**Clear timeout handling**:

```python
try:
    result = subprocess.run(
        hook_cmd,
        timeout=hook_timeout,
        capture_output=True
    )
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
    logger.error(
        f"Hook '{hook_name}' timed out after {hook_timeout}s. "
        f"Consider increasing timeout or optimizing hook."
    )
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Validate early**: Check prerequisites at configuration time, not execution time
2. **Absolute paths everywhere**: Resolve relative paths immediately to avoid confusion
3. **Auto-fix when possible**: Add execute permissions automatically rather than just failing
4. **Timeout feedback is critical**: Users need to know WHY their hook didn't complete

### Prevention

- Validate all hooks at installation/configuration time
- Convert relative paths to absolute immediately
- Set reasonable default timeouts (10s for most hooks)
- Provide clear, actionable error messages with timeout issues

## Worktree Management and Branch Isolation (2025-10-18)

### Issue

Multiple developers working on the same repository encountered:

- Lost work when switching branches
- Confusion about which worktree was active
- Stale worktrees cluttering filesystem
- Difficulty tracking multiple feature branches

### Root Cause

1. **Manual worktree management**: No standardized process for creating/managing worktrees
2. **No visual indication**: Hard to tell which worktree you're in
3. **No cleanup process**: Worktrees persisted after branches merged
4. **Path confusion**: Similar directory names across worktrees

### Solution

**Worktree manager agent** with standardized workflow:

```bash
# Create worktree with standard naming
git worktree add ./worktrees/feat/issue-123-feature-name -b feat/issue-123-feature-name

# Clear visual indication in prompt
export PS1="[worktree: feat/issue-123] $ "

# Cleanup merged worktrees
git worktree prune
```

**Standard worktree structure**:

```
./worktrees/
├── feat/
│   ├── issue-123-feature-name/
│   └── issue-456-other-feature/
├── fix/
│   └── issue-789-bug-fix/
└── docs/
    └── issue-101-documentation/
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Worktrees enable parallel development**: Work on multiple features without branch switching
2. **Naming consistency matters**: Standard format makes navigation easier
3. **Regular cleanup prevents clutter**: Prune merged worktrees regularly
4. **Visual indicators prevent confusion**: Show current worktree in prompt or status line

### Prevention

- Use worktree-manager agent for all worktree operations
- Follow standard naming convention: `./worktrees/{type}/issue-{num}-{desc}/`
- Prune worktrees after merging branches
- Configure shell prompt to show current worktree

## Context Preservation Across Sessions (2025-10-15)

### Issue

Long-running tasks or multi-session projects lost important context between Claude Code sessions, requiring users to re-explain decisions, constraints, and project history.

### Root Cause

1. **No session state persistence**: Each session started fresh with only basic context
2. **Decision rationale lost**: Why certain approaches were chosen wasn't captured
3. **No continuation mechanism**: Difficult to resume incomplete work from previous sessions
4. **Context spread across many files**: Important information scattered in various docs

### Solution

**Session continuation system**:

```markdown
# ai_working/session_state.md

## Current Task

[Description of what we're working on]

## Recent Decisions

- [Date] Chose approach X over Y because [rationale]
- [Date] Decided to defer Z until [condition]

## Next Steps

1. [What needs to happen next]
2. [Dependencies or blockers]

## Important Context

[Key information that must be preserved]
```

**Agent prompts reference session state**:

```
Before starting any task, read @ai_working/session_state.md to understand:
- What we're currently working on
- Recent decisions and their rationale
- What the next steps are
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Explicit state management beats implicit**: Write down decisions and context
2. **Rationale is as important as the decision**: Capture WHY, not just WHAT
3. **Next steps guide continuation**: Clear next actions enable easy resumption
4. **Centralized state prevents duplication**: Single source of truth for session context

### Prevention

- Update session_state.md after major decisions or milestone completion
- Include rationale for all non-obvious choices
- Review session_state.md at the start of each session
- Reference it in agent prompts and CLAUDE.md

## Philosophy Violations in Generated Code (2025-10-12)

### Issue

Agents frequently generated code that violated amplihack's core philosophy principles:

- Placeholder functions with TODO comments
- Overly complex abstractions for simple operations
- Generic "future-proof" code for hypothetical requirements
- Swallowed exceptions hiding real errors

### Root Cause

1. **Philosophy not enforced in agent prompts**: Agents didn't consistently reference PHILOSOPHY.md
2. **No validation gate**: Generated code not checked for philosophy compliance
3. **Patterns vs principles confusion**: Agents applied "best practices" that contradicted philosophy
4. **Cleanup agent too gentle**: Didn't aggressively remove unnecessary complexity

### Solution

**Mandatory philosophy check in workflow**:

```markdown
### Step 6: Refactor and Simplify

- [ ] **CRITICAL: Provide cleanup agent with original user requirements**
- [ ] **Always use** cleanup agent for ruthless simplification WITHIN user constraints
- [ ] Remove unnecessary abstractions (that weren't explicitly requested)
- [ ] Eliminate dead code (unless user explicitly wanted it)
- [ ] Verify no placeholders remain - no stubs, no TODOs, no swallowed exceptions
```

**Enhanced cleanup agent prompt**:

```
PHILOSOPHY ENFORCEMENT CHECKLIST:
❌ No TODO comments or placeholder functions
❌ No swallowed exceptions (bare except: pass)
❌ No unimplemented functions
❌ No overly generic abstractions
✅ Simple, direct implementations
✅ Explicit error handling
✅ Single responsibility per module
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Philosophy must be in agent context**: Reference PHILOSOPHY.md in every agent prompt
2. **Validation gates catch violations**: Check generated code before accepting it
3. **Be specific about anti-patterns**: Tell agents what NOT to do
4. **Cleanup is aggressive simplification**: Remove complexity, don't just organize it

### Prevention

- Include PHILOSOPHY.md reference in all agent prompts
- Run cleanup agent with explicit philosophy checklist
- Review generated code for common violations (TODOs, swallowed exceptions)
- Fail PR if philosophy violations detected

## Rate Limiting and Token Budget Management (2025-10-08)

### Issue

High-frequency agent operations hit Claude API rate limits, causing:

- Failed tool calls with cryptic 429 errors
- Degraded user experience with unexplained delays
- Wasted tokens on retry attempts
- Session crashes from unhandled rate limit errors

### Root Cause

1. **No rate limit awareness**: System didn't track API usage or respect limits
2. **Aggressive retry logic**: Immediate retries worsened rate limit violations
3. **No user feedback**: Rate limit errors looked like random failures
4. **Unbounded parallel requests**: Multiple agents could overwhelm API simultaneously

### Solution

**Rate limit protection system**:

```python
class RateLimitProtection:
    def __init__(self, requests_per_minute=50):
        self.rpm_limit = requests_per_minute
        self.request_times = []

    async def acquire(self):
        # Wait if we're at rate limit
        while len(self.request_times) >= self.rpm_limit:
            wait_time = 60 - (time.time() - self.request_times[0])
            if wait_time > 0:
                await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
            self.request_times.pop(0)

        self.request_times.append(time.time())
```

**Exponential backoff with jitter**:

```python
def exponential_backoff(attempt: int) -> float:
    base_delay = 2 ** attempt
    jitter = random.uniform(0, 0.1 * base_delay)
    return min(base_delay + jitter, 60)  # Cap at 60s
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Rate limits are real**: Respect API limits or face cascading failures
2. **Exponential backoff prevents thundering herd**: Don't retry immediately
3. **User feedback prevents confusion**: Explain why there's a delay
4. **Track usage proactively**: Don't wait for 429 to learn you're over limit

### Prevention

- Implement rate limiting for all API-heavy operations
- Use exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Display clear messages when rate limited
- Monitor token usage to stay within budget

## Agent Steps Must Run from Dedicated Worktree (2026-03-30)

### Issue

Agent steps in `default-workflow` and `consensus-workflow` ran from the repo root instead of the dedicated worktree created for the task. This caused **hollow-context execution** — nested agent sessions read stale repo state rather than the task's working directory — and parallel workflow conflicts when two workflows ran simultaneously against the same CWD.

### Root Cause

Recipe YAML step definitions with `type: agent` did not include `working_dir`. The recipe runner defaulted to the process CWD (repo root). Nested agent sessions therefore had no knowledge of the worktree created for their task.

Additionally, the recipe-runner-rs binary had a bug where relative worktree paths passed through `working_dir` were not resolved correctly, and the `working_dir` template field itself was not rendered until runner 0.3.3.

### Solution

**PR #3778**: Added `working_dir: {{worktree_path}}` to all 75 agent steps across `default-workflow.yaml` and `consensus-workflow.yaml`.

**PRs #3771, #3779, #3781**: Bumped `MIN_RUNNER_VERSION` to 0.3.1 → 0.3.2 → 0.3.3 to pick up:

- 0.3.1: Orchestrator resolved from `AMPLIHACK_HOME` (not CWD)
- 0.3.2: Relative worktree path resolution fix
- 0.3.3: Template rendering for the `working_dir` field

### Key Learnings

1. **`working_dir` is not inherited**: Every `type: agent` step in a worktree-based workflow must set `working_dir` explicitly — the runner does not propagate it automatically
2. **Hollow-context execution is silent**: Agents appear to succeed but read the wrong repo state. No error is raised; results are just wrong
3. **CWD-based workflows conflict in parallel**: Two workflows using the same CWD simultaneously overwrite each other's context and lock files

### Prevention

- Always set `working_dir: {{worktree_path}}` on every `type: agent` step in workflows that use a worktree
- Verify after adding new steps that `working_dir` is included
- Keep `MIN_RUNNER_VERSION` current when new runner features are required

## Nested Recipe Hook Reinjection Causes Recursive dev-orchestrator (2026-03-30)

### Issue

Nested recipe-managed child sessions received the same workflow-classification reminder and `AMPLIHACK.md` framework injections as top-level sessions. The child agent classified its subtask, re-invoked `dev-orchestrator`, and the recipe hijacked its own nested workflow — producing recursive orchestration instead of executing the assigned step.

### Root Cause

The `user_prompt_submit.py` hook and `workflow_classification_reminder.py` ran unconditionally for every agent session. Neither hook distinguished between a top-level interactive session (where routing injection is correct) and a nested child session started by the recipe runner (where the step context should be untouched).

A secondary issue: the `USER_PREFERENCES` parser used an older key-value format, silently dropping all preferences when the stored format had evolved to a markdown table.

### Solution

**PR #3792**:

- Added nested-session detection to `workflow_classification_reminder.py` — skips injection when inside a recipe-managed child session
- Added nested-session detection to `user_prompt_submit.py` — skips `AMPLIHACK.md` framework reinjection while preserving normal preference injection
- Updated the `USER_PREFERENCES` parser to read the current markdown-table format; added regression tests

### Key Learnings

1. **Hooks that inject routing behavior must be session-depth-aware**: A child session already has a task — re-routing it destroys the workflow
2. **Preference parsers must match the current serialization format**: Format drift silently drops all preferences without any error
3. **Test hook behavior at every session depth**: Top-level and nested sessions have fundamentally different needs

### Prevention

- Detect nested sessions (e.g., via `AMPLIHACK_SESSION_DEPTH` env var or recipe runner marker) before injecting orchestration logic
- Keep preference parser tests in sync with the stored format — any format change must include a parser update and regression test
- Validate hook output in an end-to-end nested recipe run, not just unit tests

---

## Pre-commit Hooks in Workflow Commits (2026-03-30)

### Issue

Two distinct failures around pre-commit hooks in workflow-generated commits:

1. **Step-15 (final commit) failed permanently**: Pre-commit hooks reformatted files and exited 1. The workflow treated this as a fatal commit failure, losing the work
2. **Checkpoint commits aborted long workflows**: Checkpoint steps (internal workflow bookmarks) triggered pre-commit hooks. Hook failure killed the step, aborting workflows that had been running for two hours

### Root Cause

1. Pre-commit hooks are designed to modify files and exit 1, signaling that the developer must re-stage. Step-15 in the recipe did not account for this modify-then-exit-1 pattern — it treated any non-zero exit as permanent failure
2. Checkpoint commits are workflow bookkeeping, not user-facing commits. They do not carry user code; running pre-commit hooks on them is both unnecessary and destructive when hooks fail

### Solution

**PR #3791**: Step-15 now detects the pre-commit modify-then-exit-1 pattern (exit code 1 + newly modified files present), re-stages the modified files, and retries the commit.

**PR #3786**: Checkpoint steps now use `--no-verify` (skip pre-commit hooks entirely) and `fatal: false` (hook or commit failure is non-fatal and does not abort the workflow).

### Key Learnings

1. **Pre-commit exit codes are not commit exit codes**: Exit 1 from a pre-commit hook means "re-stage and retry", not "commit failed permanently"
2. **Distinguish user commits from workflow bookkeeping commits**: User commits should run hooks; checkpoint/internal commits should not
3. **Non-critical workflow steps must be `fatal: false`**: Any step that is a checkpoint, status check, or cleanup must never abort the workflow on failure

### Prevention

- In commit-retry logic, check for modified files after hook exit 1 before classifying as permanent failure
- Mark all checkpoint, cleanup, and status-check recipe steps as `fatal: false`
- Use `--no-verify` for workflow-internal commits that do not contain user code

## Checklist CLAUDE.md Breaks Sonnet 4.5 Autonomy (2025-11-30)

### Issue

Follow-up testing to #1703 Opus experiments revealed checklist approach DEGRADES Sonnet 4.5 by causing premature workflow termination.

### Testing

Ran Sonnet 4.5 on REST API Client (HIGH complexity) with:

1. Original CLAUDE.md (baseline)
2. Checklist CLAUDE.md (Approach 2 from #1703)

### Results

**Original Sonnet**: 104m, $24, 109 turns, **22/22 steps** ✅
**Checklist Sonnet**: 36m, $8, 35 turns, **8/22 steps** ❌

### Root Cause

Checklist validation gates (STOP checkpoints, pre-flight validation) trigger Sonnet to pause and ask permission: "Would ye like me to continue?" This violates autonomy guidelines and causes premature stopping.

### Key Learning

**Model-specific behavior**: Interventions designed to force Opus completion have OPPOSITE effect on Sonnet - they cause stopping instead of continuation.

### Solution

**DO NOT implement checklist approach in production** - it breaks the model that works naturally. Use Sonnet 4.5 with original CLAUDE.md for all use cases.

###Prevention

- **Test interventions across ALL target models** - what helps one can break another
- **Validation gates harmful for autonomous models** - Sonnet needs zero checkpoints
- **No universal CLAUDE.md solution** - different models need different approaches
