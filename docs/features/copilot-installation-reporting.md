# Feature: Accurate Copilot CLI Installation Reporting

Clear and accurate installation status reporting for GitHub Copilot CLI.

## Overview

The `amplihack copilot` command now correctly reports installation success or failure with accurate messaging and appropriate exit codes. No more confusing false negatives when installation completes successfully.

## What Changed

**Before (Buggy Behavior)**:

```bash
$ amplihack copilot
Installing Copilot CLI...
Failed to install Copilot CLI  # FALSE NEGATIVE - installation worked!
[Exit code 1]
```

**After (Fixed)**:

```bash
$ amplihack copilot
Installing Copilot CLI...
Successfully installed Copilot CLI  # Accurate status
[Copilot CLI launches normally]
[Exit code 0]
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear feedback**: Users know immediately if installation succeeded or failed
2. **Correct exit codes**: CI/CD scripts can rely on exit codes (0 = success, 1 = failure)
3. **No confusion**: No more "failed" messages when installation worked
4. **Reliable automation**: Scripts can detect actual failures vs. false negatives

## Use Cases

### Fresh Installation

First-time users installing Copilot CLI:

```bash
$ which github-copilot-cli
# (no output - not installed)

$ amplihack copilot
Installing Copilot CLI...
Successfully installed Copilot CLI
Welcome to GitHub Copilot CLI...
```

### CI/CD Integration

Automated environments can trust the exit code:

```bash
# Install and launch Copilot CLI
amplihack copilot || {
    echo "Installation failed"
    exit 1
}
```

### Troubleshooting

Clear messaging helps diagnose real installation failures:

```bash
# If npm install fails (network issue, permissions, etc)
$ amplihack copilot
Installing Copilot CLI...
Failed to install Copilot CLI
[Exit code 1]

# User can check npm logs for actual error
$ npm install -g github-copilot-cli
npm ERR! network request failed...
```

## Technical Details

### Installation Verification

The fix simplifies installation verification:

1. **Check if already installed**: `shutil.which("copilot")`
2. **Install if needed**: `npm install -g @github/copilot`
3. **Trust npm exit code**: 0 = success, non-zero = failure
4. **Report status accurately**: Based on installation result

### Why the Bug Happened

The original code performed redundant verification:

```python
# Install Copilot CLI
success = install_copilot()  # npm returns success

# Redundant check (race condition)
if not shutil.which("copilot"):
    # PATH hasn't propagated yet - FALSE NEGATIVE!
    print("Failed to install...")
```

The redundant check failed due to PATH propagation timing - the binary was installed but not yet visible in the current process's PATH.

### The Fix

Trust the installer's return value instead of re-checking:

```python
# Install Copilot CLI
success = install_copilot()  # Validates via npm exit code

# Trust the result
if not success:
    print("Failed to install Copilot CLI")
    sys.exit(1)

print("Successfully installed Copilot CLI")
```

## Current runtime note

The current supported binary is `copilot`, not `github-copilot-cli`. The older
name remains in this document only as historical context for the original bug.

## Migration

**No migration required.** The fix is backward compatible:

- Existing installations continue working (no reinstall needed)
- Fresh installations now report correctly
- Scripts relying on exit codes now get accurate signals

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Test on a fresh system:

```bash
# Ensure Copilot CLI not installed
npm uninstall -g github-copilot-cli

# Test installation
amplihack copilot

# Verify success message and CLI launch
# Exit code should be 0
echo $?
```

### Automated Testing

Unit tests verify correct behavior:

```python
def test_launch_copilot_installs_when_missing():
    """Installation triggers when CLI not found."""
    with patch('shutil.which', return_value=None), \
         patch('amplihack.launcher.install_copilot', return_value=True):
        launch_copilot()  # Should succeed

def test_launch_copilot_reports_install_failure():
    """Failure reported when installation fails."""
    with patch('shutil.which', return_value=None), \
         patch('amplihack.launcher.install_copilot', return_value=False):
        with pytest.raises(SystemExit) as exc:
            launch_copilot()
        assert exc.value.code == 1  # Should exit with error
```

## Troubleshooting

If you see installation failures:

1. **Check npm**: Ensure npm is installed and accessible
2. **Check permissions**: Global npm installs require write access
3. **Check network**: npm needs to download packages
4. **Check logs**: Run `npm install -g github-copilot-cli` directly
