## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need:

1. **azlin** installed and on your PATH. azlin manages SSH connections to Azure VMs through Bastion tunnels. See [github.com/rysweet/azlin](https://github.com/rysweet/azlin) for installation.

2. **Azure VMs provisioned** and reachable via azlin. Verify with:

   ```bash
   azlin list
   ```

   You should see your VMs listed with their status.

3. **Coding agents running in tmux** on those VMs. Each VM should have one or more tmux sessions with Claude Code, Copilot, or Amplifier running inside them. The fleet admiral observes and manages these sessions.

4. **tmux** installed locally. The recipe runner uses tmux sessions for long-running workstreams that can take hours. The install script auto-installs it, or:

   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install tmux
   # macOS
   brew install tmux
   ```

5. **An Anthropic API key** set in your environment. The admiral uses Claude Opus to reason about what each agent session needs:

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   ```

## Installation

Fleet is a required part of amplihack — no optional extras needed:

```bash
cargo install amplihack-rs
```

## Using Fleet

Fleet commands work in two ways:

**From the shell:**

```bash
amplihack fleet status
amplihack fleet scout
amplihack fleet advance --session deva:rustyclawd
```

**From the Claude Code REPL (interactive session):**

```
/fleet scout
/fleet advance --session deva:rustyclawd
/fleet watch dev cybergym
```

The `/fleet` slash command is available in any amplihack-powered Claude Code or
Copilot CLI session. It provides the same commands as the shell interface.

## First Run

Verify that amplihack can see your VMs:

```bash
amplihack fleet status
```

This runs `azlin list` under the hood and displays each VM with its tmux sessions and detected agent states. If you see your VMs listed, the fleet module is working.

## The Dashboard

### Launching the TUI

Running `amplihack fleet` with no subcommand launches the interactive Textual dashboard:

```bash
amplihack fleet
```

If Textual is not installed, you get a helpful fallback message pointing you to text-based alternatives.

You can also launch explicitly:

```bash
amplihack fleet tui
amplihack fleet tui --interval 15   # Faster refresh (default: 30s)
```

### Navigation

| Key        | Action                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Arrow keys | Move between sessions in the fleet table    |
| Enter      | Dive into Session Detail for selected row   |
| Escape     | Go back to Fleet Overview                   |
| e          | Open Action Editor for the selected session |
| a          | Apply the admiral's proposed action         |
| d          | Run dry-run reasoning for selected session  |
| r          | Force refresh all sessions                  |
| q          | Quit the dashboard                          |

### Three Tabs

1. **Fleet Overview** -- The main view. A table of all sessions across all VMs with a preview pane on the right showing the last few lines of terminal output for the selected session.

2. **Session Detail** -- Deep view of a single session. Shows the full tmux capture (what the agent's terminal looks like right now) and the admiral's proposed action with its reasoning.

3. **Action Editor** -- Edit and override the admiral's proposed action before applying it. Choose an action type (send_input, wait, escalate, mark_complete, restart) and modify the input text.

### Status Icons

The dashboard uses icons to show session state at a glance:

| Icon         | Status                       | Meaning                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `◉` (green)  | thinking / working / running | Agent is actively processing                            |
| `◉` (green)  | waiting_input                | Agent asked a question, awaiting response               |
| `●` (yellow) | idle                         | Session exists but agent is not actively working        |
| `○` (dim)    | shell / empty                | No agent detected in this session                       |
| `✗` (red)    | error                        | Error detected in session output                        |
| `✓` (blue)   | completed                    | Agent finished its task (PR created, workflow complete) |

## Observing Your Fleet

Four commands give you visibility into what your agents are doing, without changing anything.

### Quick Text Summary

```bash
amplihack fleet status
```

Shows every VM, its region, tmux sessions, and detected agent state. Fast, no LLM calls.

### Watch a Single Session

```bash
amplihack fleet watch devo claude-session-1
```

Captures the last 30 lines of a specific tmux session on a specific VM. Like peeking over the agent's shoulder. Use `--lines 50` for more context.

### Snapshot All Sessions

```bash
amplihack fleet snapshot
```

Captures every session on every managed VM in one pass. Shows the last 3 lines of output per session with the observer's status classification.

### Observe with Pattern Classification

```bash
amplihack fleet observe devo
```

Runs the pattern-based observer on all sessions of a specific VM. Shows the detected status, confidence level, and which pattern matched. More detailed than `status` because it actually reads the terminal output.

## Adopting Existing Sessions

You do not need to start sessions through the fleet admiral. If you already have agents running in tmux sessions on your VMs (started manually or by another tool), you can bring them under fleet management.

### Adopt Sessions on a Single VM

```bash
amplihack fleet adopt devo
```

This connects to the VM, discovers all tmux sessions, and for each session:

1. Reads the tmux pane content to see what the agent is doing
2. Checks git state (repo, branch) in the working directory
3. Reads Claude Code JSONL logs if available
4. Creates a tracking record with inferred context
5. Begins observing without sending any commands

The output shows what was discovered:

```
Discovering sessions on devo...
Found 3 sessions:
  claude-session-1
    Repo: https://github.com/org/project
    Branch: feat/add-auth
    Agent: claude
  claude-session-2
    Repo: https://github.com/org/other-project
    Branch: fix/login-bug
    Agent: claude
  amplifier-session
    Agent: amplifier

Adopted 3 sessions:
  claude-session-1 -> task abc123
  claude-session-2 -> task def456
  amplifier-session -> task ghi789
```

### Adopt at Admiral Startup

```bash
amplihack fleet start --adopt
```

When starting the admiral, `--adopt` scans all managed VMs and brings existing sessions under management before beginning the autonomous loop.

### Adopt Specific Sessions

```bash
amplihack fleet adopt devo --sessions claude-session-1 --sessions claude-session-2
```

Only adopt named sessions, leaving others alone.

## The Admiral: Dry-Run First

The admiral is the autonomous reasoning engine. Before letting it act, use dry-run mode to see what it would do.

### Running a Dry-Run

```bash
amplihack fleet dry-run
```

For each session on each managed VM, the admiral:

1. **PERCEIVE**: Captures the tmux pane and reads JSONL transcript summaries via SSH
2. **REASON**: Sends the captured context to Claude, which decides what action to take
3. **Display**: Shows the full reasoning chain without executing anything

You can target specific VMs:

```bash
amplihack fleet dry-run --vm devo
amplihack fleet dry-run --vm devo --vm devi
```

And provide project priorities to guide decisions:

```bash
amplihack fleet dry-run --priorities "auth feature is highest priority, fix CI on project-x"
```

### What Dry-Run Shows

For each session, you see the admiral's decision:

- **Action**: `send_input`, `wait`, `escalate`, `mark_complete`, or `restart`
- **Confidence**: How sure the admiral is (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Reasoning**: Why it chose this action
- **Proposed input**: What it would type into the session (if `send_input`)

### Safety Mechanisms

The admiral has built-in safety at multiple levels:

**Thinking detection**: If an agent is actively processing (Claude Code shows `●` or `⎿`, Copilot shows `Thinking...`), the admiral skips the LLM call entirely and fast-paths to WAIT. It never interrupts a working agent.

**Confidence thresholds**: Actions below 0.6 confidence are not executed. Restart actions require 0.8 confidence.

**Dangerous input blocklist**: The admiral refuses to send commands matching dangerous patterns, regardless of confidence:

- `rm -rf`, `rm -r /`
- `git push --force`, `git push -f`
- `git reset --hard`
- `DROP TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`
- Fork bombs and disk-destructive commands

## Running the Admiral Live

After reviewing dry-run output and confirming the admiral's reasoning looks sound:

```bash
amplihack fleet start
```

The admiral begins the autonomous loop: PERCEIVE, REASON, ACT, LEARN. It polls all sessions at a configurable interval, decides what each session needs, and acts.

### Controlling the Loop

```bash
amplihack fleet start --interval 30    # Poll every 30 seconds (default: 60)
amplihack fleet start --max-cycles 10  # Stop after 10 cycles
amplihack fleet start --adopt          # Adopt existing sessions first
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the admiral gracefully.

### Single Cycle

Run one complete cycle without looping:

```bash
amplihack fleet run-once
```

Reports how many actions were taken and what they were. Useful for testing or manual orchestration.

## Task Management

The fleet has a priority-ordered task queue. Tasks describe work to be assigned to agent sessions.

### Adding Tasks

```bash
amplihack fleet add-task "Fix the authentication bug where JWT tokens expire too early" \
  --priority high \
  --repo https://github.com/org/project
```

Options:

| Flag          | Values                      | Default | Purpose                                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `--priority`  | critical, high, medium, low | medium  | Queue ordering                             |
| `--repo`      | URL                         | (none)  | Repository to clone on the target VM       |
| `--agent`     | claude, amplifier, copilot  | claude  | Which agent to use                         |
| `--mode`      | auto, ultrathink            | auto    | Agent execution mode                       |
| `--max-turns` | integer                     | 20      | Maximum agent turns                        |
| `--protected` | flag                        | false   | Deep work mode -- admiral will not preempt |

### Viewing the Queue

```bash
amplihack fleet queue
```

Shows all tasks sorted by priority with their status (queued, assigned, running, completed, failed).

### Project-Level Tracking

```bash
amplihack fleet dashboard
```

Shows fleet-wide metrics: active projects, agent utilization, cost estimates, PR counts, and task completion rates.

### Knowledge Graph

```bash
amplihack fleet graph
```

Shows the relationship graph between projects, tasks, agents, VMs, and PRs. Useful for understanding what depends on what.

### Project and Objective Tracking

Register projects and track GitHub issues as fleet objectives:

```bash
# Register a project
amplihack fleet project add https://github.com/org/myapp --name myapp --priority high

# List registered projects
amplihack fleet project list

# Track a specific issue as an objective
amplihack fleet project add-issue myapp 42 --title "Add authentication"

# Sync objectives from GitHub issues labeled 'fleet-objective'
amplihack fleet project track-issue myapp --label fleet-objective

# Remove a project
amplihack fleet project remove myapp
```

The `projects.toml` file stores project configuration:

```toml
[project.myapp]
repo_url = "https://github.com/org/myapp"
identity = "user1"
priority = "high"

[[project.myapp.objectives]]
number = 42
title = "Add authentication"
state = "open"
url = "https://github.com/org/myapp/issues/42"

[project.lib]
repo_url = "https://github.com/org/lib"
priority = "low"
```

Objectives are stored in `~/.amplihack/fleet/projects.toml` and enriched during scout with live GitHub issue state. The scout report groups sessions by project and shows open objectives:

```
--- By Project ---

  [myapp]
    objective #42: Add authentication
    objective #43: Fix login flow
    dev/auth-session [running] -> wait
    dev/login-fix [idle] -> send_input

  [unassigned]
    deva/qa [shell] -> restart
```

The SSH gather phase also queries `gh issue list --label fleet-objective` on each VM to discover objectives from the remote repository, merging them with locally registered objectives.

## Environment Variables

| Variable            | Purpose                                                         | Default                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AZLIN_PATH`        | Path to the azlin binary                                        | Auto-detected via `which azlin`, falls back to `/home/azureuser/src/azlin/.venv/bin/azlin` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API key for Claude (required for dry-run and admiral reasoning) | (none -- must be set)                                                                      |

## Running in tmux

The fleet dashboard is designed to run in its own tmux session so you can detach and reattach freely:

```bash
# Start the dashboard in a detached tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s fleet-dashboard "amplihack fleet"

# Attach anytime
tmux attach -t fleet-dashboard

# Detach without stopping: Ctrl+b, then d
```

For the admiral loop:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s fleet-admiral "amplihack fleet start --adopt --interval 30"

# Check on it
tmux attach -t fleet-admiral
```

## Auth Propagation

If your VMs need authentication tokens (GitHub CLI, Azure CLI, Claude API key):

```bash
amplihack fleet auth devo
amplihack fleet auth devo --services github azure claude
```

This copies credential files to the target VM and verifies they work.

## Using Fleet from Claude Code or Copilot CLI

The `/fleet` skill lets you manage your fleet directly from a Claude Code or Copilot CLI conversation, without switching to a separate terminal.

### Invoking the Skill

Type `/fleet` followed by a command:

```
/fleet scout
/fleet advance
/fleet status
```

Or just describe what you want — Claude will pick the right command:

```
"What are my agents doing?"        → fleet scout
"Send next steps to all sessions"  → fleet advance
"Advance the stuck session on dev" → fleet advance --session dev:stuck-session
```

### Fleet Scout (Dry-Run Scan)

`/fleet scout` is **reconnaissance** — it discovers ALL VMs and sessions including those in the exclude list (`DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_VMS`). `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_VMS` is empty by default (all VMs are fleet-managed). This is intentional: you need full visibility to understand the fleet before deciding what to act on. The exclude list only applies to admiral actions (`advance`, `start`, `run-once`) which skip excluded VMs to avoid unintended interference with shared infrastructure.

`/fleet scout` discovers all VMs and sessions, runs admiral reasoning, and shows a report with three sections:

**1. Status Table** — one row per session:

```
  VM           Session                Status     Action           Conf
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  dev          [>] cybergym-intg      running    wait             100%
  dev          [.] parallel-deploy-wk idle       send_input        90%
  deva         [X] qa                 shell      send_input        90%
  devy         [~] agent-kgpacks      thinking   wait             100%
```

Status icons: `[~]` thinking, `[>]` running, `[.]` idle, `[X]` shell (dead agent), `[Z]` suspended, `[!]` error, `[+]` completed, `[?]` waiting input.

**2. Session Summaries** — admiral reasoning + proposed input:

```
  dev/parallel-deploy-wk:
    Deployment succeeded. Agent needs to create a PR with results.
    >> "Great! The deployment completed successfully in ~21 minutes."

  deva/qa:
    Claude crashed with malformed args. Need to relaunch.
    >> "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --model opus[1m]"
```

**3. Next Steps** — copy-pasteable commands:

```
  # Act on all sessions at once:
  fleet advance

  # Advance dev/parallel-deploy-wk only:
  fleet advance --session dev:parallel-deploy-wk
  #   >> "Great! The deployment completed successfully..."

  # deva/qa is dead — inspect:
  fleet watch deva qa
```

### Fleet Advance (Live Execution)

`/fleet advance` reasons about sessions and **executes** the admiral's decisions:

```
/fleet advance                                        # All sessions (confirms each action by default)
/fleet advance --force                                # Skip confirmation, auto-execute all
/fleet advance --session dev:parallel-deploy-wk  # Single session only
```

What happens for each action type:

| Action          | What the admiral does                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `wait`          | Nothing — agent is working fine               |
| `send_input`    | Types text into the tmux pane                 |
| `restart`       | Sends Ctrl-C twice to interrupt stuck process |
| `escalate`      | Flags for human review, no action taken       |
| `mark_complete` | Records task as done                          |

Safety is enforced automatically:

- `send_input` requires confidence >= 60%
- `restart` requires confidence >= 80%
- Dangerous patterns (rm -rf, force push, etc.) are blocked

### Filtering to One Session

Both scout and advance support `--vm` and `--session` filters:

```
# Scout one VM (faster — only one Bastion tunnel):
/fleet scout --vm dev --skip-adopt

# Scout one session (fastest — ~2 min):
/fleet scout --session dev:cybergym-intg --skip-adopt

# Advance one session:
/fleet advance --session dev:cybergym-intg

# Advance one session with confirmation:
/fleet advance --session deva:qa --confirm
```

### Typical Workflow

1. **Scout first** to see the fleet state:

   ```
   /fleet scout
   ```

2. **Review** the report — check which sessions need action

3. **Advance specific sessions** you agree with:

   ```
   /fleet advance --session dev:parallel-deploy-wk
   ```

4. **Or advance all** if the admiral's proposals look good (auto-confirms each):

   ```
   /fleet advance --force
   ```

5. **Check on individual sessions** that need attention:
   ```
   /fleet watch deva qa
   ```

### Incremental Scout

After the first scout, results are saved to `~/.amplihack/fleet/last_scout.json`. On subsequent runs, use `--incremental` to skip LLM reasoning for sessions whose status hasn't changed:

```
/fleet scout --incremental
```

This dramatically reduces LLM costs when most sessions are stable.

### Saving Reports

Both commands support `--save` to write a JSON report:

```
/fleet scout --save /tmp/fleet-report.json
/fleet advance --save /tmp/advance-log.json
```

### Session State Detection

The fleet system detects eight distinct session states:

| State             | What it means                  | How detected                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **thinking**      | Agent is actively processing   | `●` tool call indicator, streaming output           |
| **running**       | Agent producing output         | Status bar shows `(running)`                        |
| **idle**          | Agent at `❯` prompt, waiting   | Claude Code prompt with no input                    |
| **shell**         | Agent dead, back at `$` prompt | Bare bash prompt, no claude/node process            |
| **suspended**     | Agent backgrounded but alive   | Bash prompt but claude/node process still running   |
| **error**         | Error detected in session      | `error:`, `traceback`, `fatal:`, `panic:` in output |
| **completed**     | Agent finished its task        | `GOAL_STATUS: ACHIEVED`, PR created/merged          |
| **waiting_input** | Agent needs user input         | `[Y/n]`, `⏵⏵ bypass`, prompt ending in `?`          |

The suspended state is detected by checking for live `claude` or `node` processes as children of the tmux pane. This catches sessions where the agent was backgrounded with Ctrl-Z or the Claude Code background feature.

The `unknown` state may appear when detection patterns do not match any known status. This is treated as requiring manual inspection.

## Next Steps

- Read the fleet orchestration architecture document in the upstream `amplihack` repository to understand how the modules fit together
- Read the Strategy Dictionary in the upstream `amplihack` repository to understand the admiral's 20 decision strategies
- Run `amplihack fleet --help` for the full command reference
