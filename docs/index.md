# amplihack-rs Documentation

amplihack-rs is the Rust implementation of the amplihack CLI. It replaces the Python-based installer with a native binary that bootstraps the complete amplihack environment in a single command.

- [Uninstall amplihack](./howto/uninstall.md) — Cleanly remove all installed files, binaries, and hook registrations
- [Resolve kuzu Linker Errors](./howto/resolve-kuzu-linker-errors.md) — Diagnose and fix `undefined reference` errors caused by `cxx`/`cxx-build` version mismatch
- [Fix the cxx-build Pin CI Failure](./howto/fix-cxx-build-ci-failure.md) — Restore the `Cargo.lock` pin when the `Verify cxx-build pin` CI step fails
- [Enable Shell Completions](./howto/enable-shell-completions.md) — Install tab-completion for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell
- [Run amplihack in Non-interactive Mode](./howto/run-in-noninteractive-mode.md) — Use amplihack in CI pipelines, Docker containers, and piped scripts without interactive prompts
- [Manage Tool Update Notifications](./howto/manage-tool-update-checks.md) — Control or disable the pre-launch npm update check for `claude`, `copilot`, and `codex`

### Reference

- [amplihack install](./reference/install-command.md) — Full CLI reference for the `install` and `uninstall` commands
- [Install Manifest](./reference/install-manifest.md) — Schema and semantics of the uninstall manifest written at install time
- [Hook Specifications](./reference/hook-specifications.md) — Canonical table of all 7 Claude Code hooks registered by amplihack
- [Binary Resolution](./reference/binary-resolution.md) — How `amplihack` locates the `amplihack-hooks` binary at install time
- [amplihack completions](./reference/completions-command.md) — Full CLI reference for the `completions` subcommand
- [Environment Variables](./reference/environment-variables.md) — All environment variables read or injected by `amplihack` during a launch

### Concepts

- [Bootstrap Parity](./concepts/bootstrap-parity.md) — Why the Rust CLI replicates the Python installer's first-install flow and what that means for users
- [Idempotent Installation](./concepts/idempotent-installation.md) — How repeated installs are safe and how existing hook registrations are updated in place
- [The cxx/cxx-build Version Contract](./concepts/cxx-version-contract.md) — Why `cxx` and `cxx-build` must share the same minor version and how a mismatch produces linker errors
- [Agent Binary Routing](./concepts/agent-binary-routing.md) — How `AMPLIHACK_AGENT_BINARY` lets the recipe runner and hooks call back into the correct AI tool

## Quick Start

```sh
# Build from source
cargo build --release

# Install amplihack (first time)
~/.cargo/bin/amplihack install

# Install from a local clone (no network)
amplihack install --local /path/to/amplihack-clone

# Remove everything amplihack installed
amplihack uninstall
```
