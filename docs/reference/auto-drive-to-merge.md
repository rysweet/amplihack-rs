# Auto Drive To Merge Reference

> [Home](../index.md) > Reference > Auto Drive To Merge

`auto-drive-to-merge` wraps [`default-workflow`](../../amplifier-bundle/recipes/default-workflow.yaml)
and drives the pull request it produces all the way to a merge. It encodes the
method of using the `crusty-old-engineer` skill as the maintainer's proxy:
iterate on the PR until crusty has zero outstanding concerns, then iterate
until every merge-ready criterion holds, then merge behind an evidence gate.

It is invocable as a recipe or as the [`auto-drive-to-merge`
skill](../../amplifier-bundle/skills/auto-drive-to-merge/SKILL.md).

## The three phases

| Phase | Brick | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Build | `autodrive-build.yaml` | Runs `default-workflow` with `no_merge: "true"` to produce a PR. Never merges. |
| 2. Crusty loop | `autodrive-crusty-loop.yaml` over `autodrive-crusty-round.yaml` | Runs `crusty-old-engineer` as the maintainer's proxy, addresses every concern, re-reviews, repeats until `crusty_verdict` is `CLEAN`. |
| 3. Merge-ready loop | `autodrive-merge-loop.yaml` over `autodrive-merge-round.yaml` | Syncs the base, runs the `qa-team` scenarios, waits for CI, applies the `merge-ready` criteria, clears blockers, repeats — then merges behind the gate. |

Phase 1 is a no-op when an open PR already exists for the branch, and the whole
workflow short-circuits when the PR is already merged.

## Why there is no iteration cap

Neither loop has a `max_rounds`, a "backstop" integer, or a wall-clock budget.
Integer caps fail in both directions:

- **A cap cuts off work that was about to converge.** Round 12 of a loop
  steadily resolving concerns is the round you least want to kill.
- **A cap lets a genuinely stuck loop burn the whole budget first.** The waste
  happens *before* the counter fires.

The signal acted on is **absence of progress**, not number of attempts. Each
round therefore ends by invoking the
[`loop-health-evaluator`](loop-health-evaluator.md) brick, which reads measured
evidence — what the round actually produced, which findings are new /
recurring / resolved, whether test and CI signals moved, whether the same text
keeps reappearing — and answers `CONTINUE`, `DONE`, or `STUCK`.

`autodrive_loop.sh` carries a round **label** (`round-3`) for reports. Nothing
compares it to a limit and no branch reads it. The guard test
`no_numeric_iteration_cap_anywhere` fails the build if a cap is ever
reintroduced.

Host safety is enforced structurally one layer down and is not this workflow's
job:

| Guard | Bounds | Refusal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #1327 sealed recursion ceiling | depth | exit `79` |
| #1332 width cap + free-memory floor | fan-out, memory | exit `79` |

Rounds run **sequentially at constant session depth**, so a long loop never
walks toward that ceiling.

## Structured verdicts

No phase advances on a model's prose impression. Every gate reads a structured
field through the canonical pipeline documented in
[Structured Verdict & Intent Parsing](structured-verdict-parsing.md):

```bash
VALUE=$(printf '%s' "$RAW" \
  | amplihack orch helper extract-json \
  | amplihack orch helper extract-field --field FIELD --default SAFE_DEFAULT)
```

Agent output is untrusted data: it reaches bash steps as an environment
variable, is fed to the helpers on stdin with `printf '%s'`, and is never
interpolated into a command position, `eval`'d, or branched on as raw prose.
Every extracted token is then matched against an exact-token allow-list; a
token outside the allow-list falls to the safe default.

| Signal | Field | Clean token | Fail-safe default | `verdict_source` values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Crusty review | `crusty_verdict` | `CLEAN` | `CONCERNS` | `crusty`, `missing_verdict`, `unparseable_verdict` |
| Merge-ready | `merge_ready_verdict` | `MERGE_READY` | `NOT_MERGE_READY` | `merge_ready`, `missing_verdict`, `unparseable_verdict`, `evidence_downgrade` |
| Loop health | `loop_verdict` | `DONE` | `STUCK` | see [loop-health-evaluator](loop-health-evaluator.md) |

**A missing or unparseable verdict is never the permissive one.** It is
`CONCERNS`, `NOT_MERGE_READY`, `STUCK` — never `CLEAN`, `MERGE_READY`, or
`CONTINUE`.

### Advancing needs two independent signals

`autodrive_loop.sh` advances a phase only when **both** hold:

1. the round's own machine-checked verdict is the clean token, **and**
2. the loop-health evaluator returned `DONE`.

`DONE` over a non-clean round verdict is an inconsistent pair and is treated as
`STUCK` — it never advances. A clean round verdict with `CONTINUE` simply runs
another confirming round, which is cheap and safe.

### Measurement outranks the model

Even an explicit `MERGE_READY` is downgraded to `NOT_MERGE_READY` when the
measured evidence disagrees: `qa_status` other than `PASS`, `ci_status` other
than `GREEN`, a merge conflict, or unresolved review threads. The downgrade is
recorded in `downgrade_reason` and adds a `measured-evidence-disagrees` finding
so the loop evaluator sees a round that did not converge.

### The crusty verdict contract

`crusty-old-engineer` historically emitted prose only. It now emits an
**opt-in** structured block — requested in the prompt, or via
`CRUSTY_OUTPUT_CONTRACT=structured` — appended after its normal review:

```json
{"crusty_verdict": "CLEAN" | "CONCERNS",
 "concerns": [{"id": "<stable-kebab-id>", "severity": "blocking|major|minor",
               "summary": "<one line>", "evidence": "<file:line or output>"}],
 "summary": "<one line>"}
```

Standalone human use is unchanged: asked a question directly, the skill answers
in its usual structure and emits no JSON. `id` must be stable across rounds and
derived from the substance of the concern — that is what lets the loop tell a
recurring concern from a new one.

## Two absolute prohibitions

1. **Never skip hooks on a commit.** No `--no-verify` and no `-n` shorthand on
   any commit this workflow makes.
2. **Never bypass branch protection.** No `--admin` on `gh pr merge`, and no
   other bypass of required checks, required reviews, or the strict
   up-to-date policy.

If a hook or a check fails, the cause is fixed. This restates the repository
policy in [Merge Flow](merge-flow.md), which already says these two are never
used, and the pre-tool-use hook that blocks the hook-skipping commit flag
outright.

They are enforced three ways, not just documented:

- **Structurally.** `autodrive_merge_gate.sh` builds its `gh` argv as a fixed
  literal list and accepts no flags from any caller, then asserts the argv is
  unchanged before executing. There is no parameter through which a bypass
  could be threaded.
- **In the prompts.** The commit instructions in both round bricks say to fix
  the cause, never to reach for a skip flag.
- **By a guard test.** `forbidden_flags_never_appear_in_an_executable_position`
  scans every recipe `command:` body, every `autodrive_*.sh` tool, and the
  skill, and fails if either flag appears anywhere but a line that explicitly
  marks it as prohibited.

## No silent merge

The merge gate does not trust the loop that preceded it. In the run that
merges, it re-verifies and records:

| Criterion | Source | Failure condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Already merged | `gh pr view --json state,mergedAt` | — (short-circuits to success; merged work is never redone) |
| PR open, not draft | `gh pr view` | any other state; `isDraft: true` |
| Merge conflicts | `mergeable`, `mergeStateStatus` | not `MERGEABLE`; `BEHIND`, `DIRTY`, `UNKNOWN` |
| Reviews | `reviewDecision` | `CHANGES_REQUESTED` |
| Review threads | GraphQL `reviewThreads` | any unresolved, not-outdated thread — **or an unreadable answer** |
| CI | `gh pr checks --json name,state,bucket` | any pending or failing check, zero checks, **or an unreadable rollup** |
| qa-team scenarios | evidence file from this run | `qa_status` other than `PASS`, or no evidence file |
| merge-ready verdict | round record from this run | not `MERGE_READY`, or captured against a different head SHA |

Every criterion binds to **one** head SHA, the evidence bundle is written to
disk **before** anything is merged, and the merge passes
`--match-head-commit "$HEAD_SHA"` so GitHub itself refuses the merge if the
head moved after the evidence was captured. That closes the check-then-merge
window without a cooperative lease.

**An unreadable criterion is a failure, never a pass.** After the merge, the
platform must confirm `MERGED`; a `gh` success the platform does not confirm is
reported as `NOT_MERGED`.

Exit codes: `0` merged (or already merged), `1` not merged with the blocker
list and the evidence bundle path, `79` terminal policy refusal.

## Exit code 79 is terminal

Exit `79` and `BLOCKED_TERMINAL` are final answers from a structural guard
(#1327 / #1332), not infrastructure hiccups. Every child invocation is checked
for them; when one appears the loop stops, surfaces the refusal, and exits `79`
itself so a parent sees a policy refusal rather than a generic failure. It is
**never** retried into — not at a deeper level, and never with a raised
ceiling.

## Recursion context propagation

`autodrive_loop.sh` exports `AMPLIHACK_TREE_ID` and `AMPLIHACK_SESSION_DEPTH`
to every child unchanged, and re-exports the inherited `AMPLIHACK_MAX_DEPTH`
verbatim. `assert_ceiling_untouched` runs before every round and before every
evaluator call; if `AMPLIHACK_MAX_DEPTH` has changed, the loop aborts rather
than continuing under a ceiling it did not inherit.

Because rounds are sequential rather than nested, depth does not grow with the
number of rounds.

## Resumability

A run that dies partway is re-runnable. Nothing merged is redone and no
resolved concern is reopened.

| Store | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | `${AMPLIHACK_STATE_DIR:-~/.amplihack/state}/auto-drive/<key>/` | Phase completions, resolved concern ids, round records, evidence bundles. |
| Ledger | a marked comment on the PR (`<!-- auto-drive-to-merge:ledger -->`) | Durable copy; rehydrates an empty local store on a different host. |
| Platform | `gh pr view --json state,mergedAt` | The **authority** on whether the PR is merged. |

Local state is a cache, never a claim: the merge gate re-verifies every
criterion regardless of what any state file says, and `UNKNOWN` platform state
is treated as a failure rather than as "not merged".

Resolved concern ids are handed back to crusty on a resumed run. Crusty may
still re-raise one — but only with new evidence in the current diff, and it is
asked to say what that evidence is.

## No short timeouts

No step in any of these recipes declares `timeout` or `timeout_seconds`, and no
recipe declares a `default_step_timeout` (issue #439 — the runner owns the
ceiling). The CI wait polls on a 60-second interval and stops when CI reaches a
terminal state or becomes unreadable; it is bounded by the build finishing, not
by a stopwatch. Test suites, builds, and model calls run to their natural end.
The guard test `no_short_timeouts_anywhere` fails the build if a seconds-scale
or single-digit-minute bound is introduced.

## Dependency on PR #1347

Both loops invoke the `loop-health-evaluator` recipe **by name**. That brick,
the `amplihack orch helper normalise-loop-verdict` helper, and
[its reference](loop-health-evaluator.md) ship with PR #1347 (issue #1337).
They are deliberately **not** reimplemented or copied here — one loop-health
contract, used by every loop that needs one. Until #1347 lands, the two loops
in this workflow cannot resolve their terminator at runtime.

Nothing else in this workflow depends on #1347: the verdicts it parses itself
use only `extract-json` / `extract-field`, which are already on `main`, so the
tests here run and pass without #1347.
