# Hook Specifications Reference

amplihack registers 7 hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json` when you run `amplihack install`. This page documents each hook: its Claude Code event, the binary or script that runs, and its timeout.

## Canonical Hook Table

| # | Claude Code Event | Command Kind | Command | Timeout |
|---|------------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | `SessionStart` | Binary subcommand | `amplihack-hooks session-start` | 10 s |
| 2 | `Stop` | Binary subcommand | `amplihack-hooks stop` | 120 s |
| 3 | `PreToolUse` | Binary subcommand | `amplihack-hooks pre-tool-use` | *(none)* |
| 4 | `PostToolUse` | Binary subcommand | `amplihack-hooks post-tool-use` | *(none)* |
| 5 | `UserPromptSubmit` | Binary subcommand | `amplihack-hooks workflow-classification-reminder` | 5 s |
| 6 | `UserPromptSubmit` | Binary subcommand | `amplihack-hooks user-prompt-submit` | 10 s |
| 7 | `PreCompact` | Binary subcommand | `amplihack-hooks pre-compact` | 30 s |

## Hook Format in settings.json

Each hook is written as a wrapper object under the event key:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/alice/.local/bin/amplihack-hooks session-start",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/alice/.local/bin/amplihack-hooks pre-tool-use"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/alice/.local/bin/amplihack-hooks workflow-classification-reminder",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/alice/.local/bin/amplihack-hooks user-prompt-submit",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Key points:**

- `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` have no `timeout` field. Absence means fail-open (no timeout enforced by Claude Code).
- Both `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` use matcher `"*"` to intercept all tool calls.
- The two `UserPromptSubmit` entries must appear in order: `workflow-classification-reminder` first, then `user-prompt-submit`. The installer preserves this order on both fresh install and idempotent update.
- Hook commands are written with the **absolute path** to `amplihack-hooks` resolved at install time. If the binary moves, re-run `amplihack install` to update the paths.

## Hook Descriptions

### 1. SessionStart — `session-start`

Runs when Claude Code starts a new session. Initializes session context, checks for version mismatches natively in Rust, and migrates stale global amplihack hook registrations out of `~/.claude/settings.json`.

### 2. Stop — `stop`

Runs when Claude Code stops. Triggers native Rust reflection prompt assembly plus Claude CLI analysis, saves session memory, and handles lock-mode signaling. 120-second timeout allows the reflection write to complete.

### 3. PreToolUse — `pre-tool-use`

Runs before every tool call (matcher `*`). Validates Bash commands against the amplihack allow-list and records metrics. No timeout — fail-open so tool calls are never blocked by a slow hook.

### 4. PostToolUse — `post-tool-use`

Runs after every tool call (matcher `*`). Records tool usage metrics. No timeout — fail-open.

### 5. UserPromptSubmit — `workflow-classification-reminder`

The **first** of two `UserPromptSubmit` hooks. Injects a workflow classification reminder into the prompt context. Runs via `amplihack-hooks`. 5-second timeout.

### 6. UserPromptSubmit — `user-prompt-submit`

The **second** of two `UserPromptSubmit` hooks. Injects user preferences and native Rust memory context for referenced agents into the prompt. Runs via `amplihack-hooks`. 10-second timeout.

### 7. PreCompact — `pre-compact`

Runs before Claude Code compacts the context window. Exports the current transcript so it can be referenced after compaction.

## Hook Runtime Location

Fresh installs register hooks through the native `amplihack-hooks` binary deployed at `~/.local/bin/amplihack-hooks`. The installer writes command strings such as `amplihack-hooks session-start` and `amplihack-hooks user-prompt-submit` into `~/.claude/settings.json`.
