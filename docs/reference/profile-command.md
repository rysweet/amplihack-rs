## Subcommands

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `add <name>` | Copy allowlisted shared assets from `~/.claude` into a private staging directory, then atomically publish `<root>/<name>/` (mode `0700` on Unix; Windows uses its inherited ACL). Errors if a profile exists whose name matches case-insensitively, on every platform. Does not run Claude. |
| `list` | One profile per line, sorted; the default is marked `*`. Skips dot-entries, symlinks and non-directories. Reports a corrupt or dangling default pointer instead of silently omitting the marker. |
| `show` | Prints `name: <name>` and `dir: <path>`, or `none`. Paths only; never directory contents. |
| `switch <name>` | Writes the default pointer. The profile must exist. |
| `remove <name>` | Requires `--yes`. Resolves and verifies the path is inside the root, reads the default pointer, deletes the directory, then clears a matching pointer. A missing pointer means no default; a corrupt, unreadable or dangling pointer fails closed before any deletion (repair with `switch`). Never deletes the root; never follows symlinks. |
| `login <name>` | Always runs the `claude` binary (ignores binary selection), interactively, with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<profile dir>`. |
| `run <name> -- <args>` | One-shot launch through the normal launch path. Args are forwarded as a literal argv vector; no shell is involved. |
| `auto-switch …` | Turn [auto-switch](#auto-switch) on or off, set its threshold and exclusions, show its state, or install and repair the status-line wrapper. See [Auto-switch commands](#auto-switch-commands). |

`remove` and `login` are also refused while auto-switch has an account's
login away from home; see [Leases](#leases).

## Configuration

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE_ROOT` | Profile root. Must be absolute and non-empty. Default `~/.amplihack/claude-profiles/`. |
| `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` | Profile name a launch passes to its children so nested launches use the same profile. Set by amplihack on the child process; may also be set by hand. Empty means unset. See [Resolution and environment](#resolution-and-environment). |
| `<root>/<name>/` | Profile directory (mode `0700` on Unix; Windows uses its inherited ACL). |
| Root directory | Created with mode `0700` on Unix; Windows uses its inherited ACL. A symlinked root is refused. An existing custom root is trusted input. |
| `<root>/.default` | Pointer file: only the profile name (mode `0600` on Unix, max 256 bytes). Windows uses its inherited ACL. Written by creating a new temp file (`create_new`, never through a symlink) and renaming it over the pointer. |
| `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_AUTO_SWITCH` | `1` turns auto-switch on and `0` turns it off for this process and its children, overriding `<root>/.auto-switch`. Empty means unset. See [Toggle and precedence](#toggle-and-precedence). |
| `<root>/.auto-switch` | Auto-switch settings. See [Settings file](#settings-file). |
| `<root>/.auto-switch.d/` | Auto-switch state. See [State directory](#state-directory). |

### Seeding

`add` calls the store's `seed_shared_assets`, which copies from the source
`$HOME/.claude` into the new profile by value. The allowlists are fixed
constants:

| Constant | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `SHARED_ASSET_FILES` | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `SHARED_ASSET_DIRS` | `agents`, `commands`, `output-styles`, `rules`, `skills` |
| `SHARED_SETTINGS_KEYS` | top-level `settings.json` keys: `alwaysThinkingEnabled`, `attribution`, `cleanupPeriodDays`, `hooks`, `includeCoAuthoredBy`, `language`, `model`, `outputStyle`, `permissions`, `respectGitignore`, `spinnerVerbs`, `statusLine` (12 keys) |

Rules:

- `settings.json` is parsed and only `SHARED_SETTINGS_KEYS` are written to the
  profile's `settings.json`. If nothing survives the filter, no file is
  written. `env`, `apiKeyHelper` and all unknown keys are dropped.
- On Unix, directories are created `0700` and files `0600`; Windows uses
  inherited ACLs. Files use `create_new` (`O_EXCL` on Unix), so nothing is
  overwritten and no destination symlink is followed.
- The 12-key list is kept in sync with the code by `tests_docs_sync.rs`, which
  checks both directions (every constant key is documented here and in the
  how-to guide, and no extra key is documented).
- A symlinked source root fails with `SymlinkRefused`. Nested symlinks and
  special files (FIFOs, sockets, devices) are skipped. On Unix the source root
  is opened exactly once with `O_RDONLY|O_DIRECTORY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC` and
  that descriptor anchors the whole copy. The five allowlisted directories,
  `CLAUDE.md` and `settings.json` are opened with `openat(root_fd, name, ...)`
  and `O_NOFOLLOW`, never by absolute path, so replacing `~/.claude` (or any
  ancestor) with a symlink after the anchor is taken cannot redirect the copy:
  the descriptor still pins the original directory. Ancestors of the root are
  resolved once, at anchor time. Each directory is opened with
  `O_NOFOLLOW|O_DIRECTORY` and entries are read and stat'ed relative to it
  (`openat`/`fstatat` with `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW`), so a directory swapped for a
  symlink during the copy is never followed. Files are opened `O_NOFOLLOW`
  and `O_NONBLOCK`, verified as regular files with `fstat` on the opened
  descriptor, and read through that same descriptor with a bounded read. Entry
  names must be a single path component. A missing `CLAUDE.md` or
  `settings.json` is skipped. Only the final component of the root is
  no-follow: a symlinked ancestor of `~/.claude` is resolved normally, once.
  Windows opens source files with `FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT` and rejects
  reparse-point handles; its path-based directory traversal still permits
  same-user ancestor/directory races. Other non-Unix platforms keep the
  path-based copy without descriptor-relative hardening.
- A missing `~/.claude` source produces an empty profile. An existing source
  that is not a directory fails the add and rolls back the new profile.
- The profile root cannot be inside the shared source tree. This is checked
  before the root is created, including for missing path suffixes, to prevent
  recursive seeding.
- Caps: nesting is limited to 16 levels, a seed to 5,000 entries, each file to
  64 MiB, and `settings.json` to 1 MiB; exceeding a cap is an error. Special
  files are skipped without being opened, so a FIFO cannot block the copy.
- Excluded entirely: `.credentials.json`, `.claude.json`, `history*`,
  `projects`, `sessions`, `todos`, `statsig`, `shell-snapshots`, `ide`,
  and every other entry not on the allowlists (so plugins and MCP server
  settings are not carried over).
- Invalid `settings.json` yields `InvalidSharedSettings`. A seeding error
  removes the private staging directory so no profile is published; if cleanup
  also fails, the error reports both failures (never a pre-existing profile).
- Values are never logged; messages contain paths and counts only.
- No sync after creation: later edits to `~/.claude` do not update profiles.

## Name rules

Pattern `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}$` (validated before any path join). Additionally rejected: `..`
anywhere, trailing `.`, path separators, NUL, and Windows-reserved names
(`CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1-9`, `LPT1-9`, also with an extension,
case-insensitive). `add` rejects names that differ only by case from an existing profile on
every platform, so `Work` and `work` can never coexist.

## Resolution and environment

`amplihack claude`, `amplihack launch` and `amplihack profile run` pick a
profile in this order:

1. `--profile <name>` (or the `<name>` given to `profile run`). The inherited
   variable and the pointer are not read, so a dangling or corrupt pointer
   does not block it.
2. An inherited, non-empty `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE`. The pointer is not
   read, even if it is dangling.
3. `<root>/.default`
4. none — `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is left exactly as inherited.

When a profile resolves, three variables are set on the child `Command` only
(never `set_var`), and only for Claude-compatible binaries. This applies to
every command that starts Claude with a profile: `amplihack claude`,
`amplihack launch`, `amplihack profile run` and `amplihack profile login`.

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | `<root>/<name>`, overriding any ambient value |
| `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` | `<name>` |
| `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE_ROOT` | `<root>`, only when `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE_ROOT` was set in the launching process; otherwise left unset so the child uses the default root too |

Copilot and Codex children get none of these, but variables already in the
environment pass through them unchanged.

### Nested launches keep the parent's profile

Every `amplihack claude` started inside a profiled session (recipe agent
steps, `multitask`/orch workstreams, a nested `amplihack claude` run by hand)
inherits `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` and so resolves the same profile at tier 2.
The pin holds for the whole tree of sessions:

- A later `amplihack profile switch` only rewrites the pointer. Running
  sessions, and every launch started from them, keep their profile.
- A parent started with `--profile work` while the pointer names `personal`
  runs every descendant as `work`.

How the name reaches each kind of descendant:

| Launch path | How the variables arrive |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Direct child, `amplihack recipe run` | Inherited environment (the recipe runner is detached with `setsid` but keeps the environment). |
| Recipe agent steps | Inherited environment. `recipe-runner-rs` builds each step's environment from its own, and never drops `AMPLIHACK_*` variables when it trims the environment to fit (checked at the revision pinned in `claude-plugin/recipe-runner.rev`, `b4a82e7`). Agent steps take no per-step environment. In bash steps, a step's `env:` block can set any variable, including these, and so can the runner's uppercase export of context keys (see [Recipe context cannot set the profile](#recipe-context-cannot-set-the-profile)). |
| `multitask` / orch workstreams | Inherited environment: each workstream's `run.sh` is started with the parent's full environment. As a backup, the generated `run.sh` also exports `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` and `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE_ROOT`, single-quoted, when they are set and non-empty, so a `run.sh` re-run by hand or on resume uses the same profile. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is not exported; the nested launch rebuilds it from the name and checks it again. If either variable is set but is not valid UTF-8, the workstream is refused before any script is written (the error names the variable, not its value), because leaving it out would send the nested launch to the default root. |

Only the name and the root are passed on. Each nested launch resolves the
name against the root and runs the full check below again, so an inherited
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is never trusted on its own.

An inherited value is checked exactly like a flag: it is parsed with the
[name rules](#name-rules) without trimming (so `" work"` is invalid), resolved
inside the root, and re-validated before spawn. Any failure — an invalid
name, a value that is not valid UTF-8, a profile that no longer exists, a
symlinked or out-of-root directory — aborts the launch with the
inherited-profile error. It never falls back to the pointer or to no profile.

You can set the variable by hand to pin a profile for one shell or command:

```bash
AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE=work amplihack recipe run default-workflow
```

A stale export in a shell startup file acts as a per-shell default that beats
the pointer; `unset AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` removes it.

`amplihack recipe run` and `amplihack multitask` do not resolve a profile
themselves. Started from a plain shell with no inherited
`AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE`, each agent step resolves the pointer on its own,
so a `profile switch` part way through moves later steps to the new profile.
Start them from inside an `amplihack claude` session, or set
`AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` as above, to pin one profile for the whole run.

Fleet and remote VM launches do not pass the profile on, so nested launches
inside them use the pointer.

Copilot and Codex launches don't set the variables themselves, but they don't
remove an inherited value either. A nested `amplihack claude` started from a
Copilot session that inherited `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` uses that profile
and checks it again. Without it, the launch uses the pointer.

### Recipe context cannot set the profile

`amplihack recipe run` refuses any context key whose uppercase form starts
with `AMPLIHACK_`, on both the `--set` and the `--context-file` path, before
the runner starts:

```text
recipe context key "amplihack_claude_profile" is reserved: the AMPLIHACK_ namespace cannot be set from recipe context
```

Only the key is printed, never its value. Keys that merely contain
`amplihack` (such as `use_amplihack`) are allowed.

Known limitation: the recipe runner itself still exports every top-level
context key to bash steps under its uppercase name. A recipe's own YAML
`context:` default or a step `output:` named `amplihack_claude_profile` (or
`amplihack_claude_profile_root`) is not checked by amplihack and can override
the pinned value for an `amplihack claude` run inside a bash step. The name
and directory are still validated, so this can only select one of your own
profiles. The runner fix is tracked in
[rysweet/amplihack-recipe-runner#146](https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-recipe-runner/issues/146).

### Pre-spawn check

Immediately before spawn, the profile path is
re-resolved and re-validated: it must be a real directory (not a symlink),
its canonical path must equal the expected path under the profile root, and
it must be owned by the current user with no group/other permission mode bits
(`mode & 0o077 == 0`: `0700` passes; `0755`, `0750` and `0705` fail). ACLs are
not inspected. Only the profile directory is checked, not its parents.
If the check fails, run `chmod go-rwx <profile-directory>` on Unix.
Any failure aborts the launch. This check applies only to profile launches;
Claude and Copilot launches without a profile are unchanged.
Ownership and group/other mode-bit checks are available on Unix. On other
platforms, profile launches still require a real, contained directory, but
the operating system does not expose the same checks through this command.

The profile selects a configuration directory; it does not change Claude's
authentication environment. Claude Code documents separate directories for
claude.ai logins and API-key accounts, but two Claude Console sign-ins without
API keys are not isolated because their credentials live outside the
configuration directory. An inherited `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` can also select API
billing instead of a subscription login. See the official
[multiple-account](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication#log-in-with-multiple-accounts)
and [environment variable](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars)
documentation.

`profile run` applies the same check as `launch --profile`: if Docker is
active (including `AMPLIHACK_USE_DOCKER`), it fails with the unsupported-mode
error before resolving or creating anything. It never silently drops the
profile.

`--profile` together with `--docker` or `--auto` fails with an
unsupported-mode error before anything is spawned. This includes Docker
activated through the environment (`AMPLIHACK_USE_DOCKER`). With Docker
activated that way and only a default pointer, the pointer is not applied and
a warning is printed.

An inherited, non-empty `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` is refused the same way.
With `--docker`, `--auto` or Docker activated through the environment, the
launch fails with the inherited-profile error and reason `not applied with
--docker, --auto or Docker`:

```
error: inherited AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE "work": not applied with --docker, --auto or Docker
hint: unset AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE and CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR to run with --docker/--auto
```

The refusal happens before the value is parsed and before the profile root
is opened, so the value drives no filesystem reads. A value that is not
valid UTF-8 gets the same refusal, not an invalid-name error. An empty value
counts as unset and does not trigger it.

These modes never set, change or re-check `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. A launch
that gets past the refusal keeps whatever `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` it inherited,
with no pre-spawn check. Inside a profiled session that is still the
parent's profile directory, so unsetting `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` alone
would run an `--auto` launch on the parent's account, not the default one.
Unset both variables for that one command:

```bash
env -u AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE -u CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR amplihack claude --auto -- -p "summarise the README"
```

A `--docker` launch does not forward `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` into the
container, but unsetting both is still the safe form to use.

Amplihack's own orchestration (recipe agent steps, `multitask`/orch
workstreams) never passes `--docker` or `--auto` to nested launches. It does
not clear `AMPLIHACK_USE_DOCKER`, though. A profiled session can carry a
truthy `AMPLIHACK_USE_DOCKER` if you export it inside the session, or if it
was exported when the session started but the Docker daemon was not running
(env-activated Docker only applies when the daemon is up). Once the daemon is
running, every nested launch of a recipe or `multitask` run started from that
session is refused with the error above. Unset `AMPLIHACK_USE_DOCKER` before
starting the run. Inside a container `AMPLIHACK_USE_DOCKER` has no effect,
so nested launches there are not refused.

A default pointer on its own is never an error in these modes: with
`--docker` or `--auto` it is not read, and with Docker activated through the
environment it is skipped with the warning above.

A symlinked profile root is refused by every subcommand and by the pointer
reads/writes; a missing root is treated as empty.

## Literal argument forwarding

`run <name> -- <args>` passes args as an argv vector with no shell, so
`amplihack profile run work -- "; rm -rf ~"` hands that string to Claude
as one literal argument and executes nothing.

## Auto-switch

Auto-switch moves work from an account that is close to its usage limit to
another profile with quota left. It is off by default. The
[how-to](../howto/claude-profiles.md#switch-accounts-automatically) walks
through using it; this section defines its behaviour.

### What "off" means

With the switch off and no `<root>/.auto-switch.d/` directory:

- the lease and recovery guards make one metadata check (does
  `<root>/.auto-switch.d/` exist?) and stop;
- launches, nested substitution and the rerun supervisor read
  `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_AUTO_SWITCH` once and, unless it decides the setting, make
  at most one bounded read of `<root>/.auto-switch` (4096 bytes).

Nothing else happens. No directory is created, no lock is taken, no usage is
recorded, no profile is substituted, no output is buffered and no step is
rerun. Behaviour is the same as without the feature. The status-line wrapper,
if installed, runs the original status line and records nothing.

If `<root>/.auto-switch.d/` exists, the [lease](#leases) and
[recovery](#session-end-and-recovery) checks run whatever the toggle says,
so a login moved while the switch was on stays protected after `off`.

### Auto-switch commands

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `auto-switch on [--threshold N] [--exclude a,b]` | Writes `enabled=on`, plus the threshold and exclusions if given, and prints `auto-switch: on (threshold N%)`. If any profile's [status-line wrapper](#status-line-wrapper) is `missing` or `stale`, prints the `profiles without the wrapper` [note](#status-notes) to stderr. |
| `auto-switch off` | Writes `enabled=off`. The threshold and exclusions are kept. Logins in running sessions are not moved; they return when each session ends. |
| `auto-switch status` | **Read-only.** Takes no lock, runs no recovery and changes nothing on disk. Prints the effective setting and where it comes from (`env`, `file`, `default` or `corrupt`), the threshold, the exclusions, whether in-session swaps are available, one row per profile (latest readings, where its login is, wrapper state), the hosted directories, an invariant line, and then any [notes](#status-notes). Prints profile names, percentages and times only. |
| `auto-switch threshold N` | Sets the threshold, `1` to `100`. Keeps `enabled` and `exclude`. |
| `auto-switch exclude [names…]` | Replaces the exclusion list. With no names, clears it. Each name must pass the [name rules](#name-rules); it does not have to exist (`status` lists names that do not). Keeps `enabled` and `threshold`. |
| `auto-switch install` | Adds the [status-line wrapper](#status-line-wrapper) to every profile that does not have it. Leaves a stale wrapper alone and reports it. Prints the root it acts on. |
| `auto-switch repair` | If `<root>/.auto-switch.d/` exists, takes the global lock and runs [recovery](#session-end-and-recovery). Then does everything `install` does, and also rewrites stale wrappers (old or moved binary path, wrapped twice, edited by hand) to the canonical one. Prints the install lines, then one `recovery:` line per thing recovery did, or `recovery: nothing to do`. This is the only command whose purpose is recovery. |

`status` prints `wrapper` as `installed`, `missing`, `stale` (an older or
edited wrapper command, one wrapped twice, or one pointing at a different
binary) or `unsafe` (the binary is in a location `install` would refuse).
The `in-session swap` line is `available (Linux)` or
`unavailable (<reason>)`; see [Platform support](#platform-support).
The invariant line is `invariant: ok (every login is in exactly one place)`,
`invariant: pending recovery` when a swap journal is waiting, or
`invariant: PROBLEM: <problem>` naming the profile and the problem (a
damaged ledger or journal, a journal marked `inconsistent`, or a login that
is not where the ledger says).

`install` and `repair` print one line per profile: the outcome, the name and
a detail.

| Outcome | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| `unchanged` | (none) |
| `installed` | `(no previous status line)`, `(wrapped existing status line)` or `(restored the saved status line)` |
| `stale` (`install` only) | `(wrapper pointed at a different binary)` or `(wrapper command differs from the canonical one)`, followed by `— run: amplihack profile auto-switch repair` |
| `repaired` (`repair` only) | `(wrapper pointed at a different binary)` or `(wrapper command differs from the canonical one)` |

The `recovery:` lines `repair` prints are
`recovery: rolled back an interrupted swap in <dir>`,
`recovery: finished an interrupted swap in <dir>` and
`recovery: returned the login of <account> hosted in <dir> (session ended)`.

Both `install` and `repair` are idempotent: a second run leaves every
`settings.json` byte-identical. Neither resolves or writes `~/.claude`.
`profile add` does not install the wrapper; run `install` after it.

#### Status notes

`status` prints these notes after the invariant line, each as
`note: <text>` on its own line, only when they apply:

| Note | When |
|------|------|
| `interrupted swap pending — run: amplihack profile auto-switch repair` | `journal.json` exists. `status` never acts on it. |
| `stale lease: <dir> (session ended) — run: amplihack profile auto-switch repair` | A hosted directory is no longer live. `status` does not return it. |
| `ignored AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_AUTO_SWITCH value (use 1 or 0); the file decides` | The variable is set to something other than `1`, `0` or empty. |
| `profiles without the wrapper: <names> — run: amplihack profile auto-switch install` | A profile's wrapper is `missing` or `stale`. |
| `excluded but missing: <names>` | An exclusion names no existing profile. |
| `profiles <a> and <b> are signed in to the same account; their readings are not reliable` | Two profiles' `oauthAccount.accountUuid` values are equal: from the profile's own `.claude.json`, or from its saved block while its directory hosts another account. The UUID itself is not printed. |

Every command takes the global state lock only when it needs it, and exits
with status 1 on error with the usual `error:`/`hint:` lines.

### Settings file

`<root>/.auto-switch` holds `key=value` lines, written in this order:

```
enabled=on
threshold=90
exclude=review,shared
```

| Key | Values | Default |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `enabled` | `on` or `off`. Required. | — |
| `threshold` | Integer `1` to `100`, in percent. | `90` |
| `exclude` | Comma-separated profile names, may be empty. | empty |

It is written like `.default`: a new temp file in the same directory
(`create_new`, mode `0600`, never through a symlink), synced, renamed over the
file, and the directory synced. Rewrites produce identical bytes for an
identical setting.

The file is *corrupt*, and the switch counts as off, if it is larger than
4096 bytes, not UTF-8, not a regular file, not owned by the current user,
has an unknown or repeated key, has no `enabled`, or has an out-of-range
value. `status` shows `switch: off (corrupt)`.

What each command writes depends on the current file:

| Current `.auto-switch` | `on` / `off` | `threshold N` / `exclude …` |
|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| valid | rewrites it with the new `enabled` | rewrites it, keeping the other keys |
| missing | creates it | creates it with `enabled=off`, defaults for the key not given |
| corrupt regular file owned by you | replaces it; `threshold` and `exclude` start from their defaults unless given | refused with `AutoSwitchConfig`; run `on` or `off` first |
| owned by another user | refused with `AutoSwitchConfig` | refused with `AutoSwitchConfig` |
| symlink or not a regular file | refused with `AutoSwitchConfig` | refused with `AutoSwitchConfig` |

A file is never written through a symlink, and a file owned by someone else
is never replaced.

The file is read again on every check and never cached, so a change applies
to running sessions from their next check.

### Toggle and precedence

| `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_AUTO_SWITCH` | Effective setting |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| `1` | on |
| `0` | off |
| unset or empty | the file's `enabled`; off if the file is missing or corrupt |
| anything else | the file decides; one warning per process goes to stderr, and `status` shows the [note](#status-notes) |

Only `1` and `0` are recognised. The file is read on every check, so a
change to it applies to running sessions from their next check. The variable
is inherited when a session starts and cannot be changed afterwards; while it
is set, it overrides the file, so `=1` keeps switching on even after
`auto-switch off`. The threshold and exclusions always come from the file.

### Readings

A *reading* is the latest usage seen for one account:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "accounts": {
    "work": {
      "five_hour": { "used_percentage": 93.0, "resets_at": 1760630400 },
      "seven_day": { "used_percentage": 61.0, "resets_at": 1761040800 },
      "observed_at": 1760621000,
      "source": "statusline"
    }
  }
}
```

That is `<root>/.auto-switch.d/usage.json`. Times are Unix epoch seconds.
`source` is `statusline` for readings from the wrapper and
`usage_limit_failure` for a reading recorded from a step that hit its usage
limit (see [Usage-limit reruns](#usage-limit-reruns)).

- **Parsing.** Status-line input is capped at 1 MiB and only its
  `rate_limits` object is read. `resets_at` is accepted as epoch seconds
  (integer or float) or RFC 3339. A window is dropped if its percentage is
  not a finite number or its `resets_at` is not within one day before to
  eight days after now. Percentages are clamped to `0`–`100`. Input without
  `rate_limits` records nothing.
- **Reset.** A window whose `resets_at` is at or before now counts as 0%.
- **Attribution.** A reading belongs to the account whose login is live in
  that directory (per the ledger), not to the directory's owner.
- **Identity.** An account is identified by the name of the profile that
  owns its login. Leases, the ledger and readings all use that name;
  `oauthAccount` is only used to patch what Claude displays. Two profiles
  signed in to the same Anthropic account are not supported: they are
  treated as two accounts, and `status` warns about them.
- **After a swap.** For 300 seconds after a swap, readings from that
  directory are not recorded and do not trigger another swap. After that, a
  reading identical to the last reading before the swap (same percentages and
  reset times) is still ignored, because it describes the previous account.
- **Merging.** The reading with the newer `observed_at` wins; on a tie, the
  one with the higher usage wins.
- **Errors.** A damaged `usage.json` is treated as empty and overwritten by
  the next reading.

### Candidate selection

An account is *exhausted* when the higher of its two adjusted windows is
at or above the threshold (`max(five_hour, seven_day) >= threshold`). An
*adjusted* window is one whose `resets_at` is at or before now, which counts
as 0%. A window without `resets_at` is used as read. An account with no
reading is not exhausted. Exhausted accounts are never chosen.

An account is *eligible* when it is not excluded, not the current account,
not [leased](#leases), and not exhausted, plus the extra conditions for an
[in-session swap](#in-session-swap) or a
[nested launch](#nested-launches-and-auto-switch).

Eligible accounts are ordered:

1. accounts with a reading, by the higher of their two adjusted windows,
   lowest first, then by name;
2. accounts with no reading, by name.

The first one is chosen. A known reading below the threshold always beats
no reading. If none is eligible, nothing is switched. The
exclusion list only stops an account being chosen; an excluded account that
is current can still be switched away from.

### Status-line wrapper

`install` and `repair` set each profile's `statusLine` to a hidden command:

```json
"statusLine": {
  "type": "command",
  "command": "'/home/ryan/.local/bin/amplihack' profile statusline --root '/home/ryan/.claude-profiles' --owner 'work'",
  "padding": 0
}
```

The binary path is the one that ran `install`. Each value is single-quoted
for `sh`; a path containing NUL, a newline or non-UTF-8 bytes is refused.
The original `statusLine` object is saved in
`<root>/.auto-switch.d/statusline/<name>.json` and run by the wrapper.

| The profile's `statusLine` is… | `install` | `repair` |
|--------------------------------|-----------|----------|
| the canonical wrapper | does not write | does not write |
| missing | installs the wrapper; uses a saved original if one exists | same as `install` |
| another command | saves it as the original, then installs the wrapper | same as `install` |
| an old, moved, edited or doubly wrapped wrapper (contains `profile statusline`) | does not write; reports `stale` | rewrites it to the canonical wrapper, keeping the saved original (never saving a wrapper as the original) |

The original `padding` is kept. A missing `settings.json` is created at
`0600`. Writes use a temp file, `rename` and a directory sync. Other keys and
their values are kept; key order may change. `install` checks each profile
directory like a launch does, refuses a symlinked `settings.json`, and never
resolves or writes `~/.claude`. It refuses to install when the amplihack
binary, or any directory above it, is writable by group or others or is owned
by someone other than you or root. Group write is accepted only for your own
private group (a group named like your user with no listed members, the
usual layout with a umask of `002`). It warns when the binary is inside a
`target/` directory. There is no uninstall command; restore the saved
original by hand if you need to.

When Claude runs the wrapper, it:

1. checks that `--root` is absolute and private, that `--owner` is a valid
   name, and that `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` resolves to `<root>/<owner>`. If any
   check fails, it only runs the original status line;
2. waits at most 50 ms for the state lock, then runs
   [recovery](#session-end-and-recovery) if `<root>/.auto-switch.d/`
   exists and, if the switch is on, records the reading. If the lock is
   still busy after 50 ms, it skips recovery, the update and the swap check
   for this run; the next wrapper run, launch, login or `repair` runs them.
   It never delays or changes the output;
3. runs the original command with `sh -c`, the same standard-input bytes,
   working directory and environment, and copies its standard output through
   byte for byte;
4. runs the [in-session swap](#in-session-swap) check.

The saved original in `statusline/<name>.json` is run only if it passes the
[state directory](#state-directory) checks (a regular file owned by you,
mode `0600`, not a symlink, at most 64 KiB, valid JSON). If it fails them, the
wrapper does not run it, prints nothing to standard output (Claude shows an
empty status line), and writes one stderr line naming the path and telling
you to run `amplihack profile auto-switch repair`.

If the `--root` it was installed with is not an absolute path, cannot be
resolved, or fails the profile-root checks (a real directory owned by you and
not writable by other users), the wrapper does nothing else: it runs neither
the original status line nor any bookkeeping, prints nothing to standard
output, and writes one stderr line, `auto-switch: status line disabled:
profile root <path>: <reason>`.

#### Trigger point and coverage

The wrapper is the only passive source of `rate_limits`: hooks receive no
usage data. It is therefore the trigger for in-session swaps, which happen
only in sessions that render a status line (interactive sessions).
Non-interactive `claude -p` launches may never run the status line. They are
covered instead by [nested substitution](#nested-launches-and-auto-switch)
when they start and by [usage-limit reruns](#usage-limit-reruns) when they
fail.

The wrapper never writes to standard output itself. Its exit code is the
original command's, or `0` if there is none or it was not run. Its own errors, including a
panic, are one line on stderr naming paths only.

### In-session swap

Runs from the wrapper, on Linux only, when the switch is on and the session's
account is exhausted. The target must be eligible and, in addition, its login
must be in its home slot, and if that home slot is its own profile directory,
no running process may be using that directory.

The *home slot* of account `X` is `<root>/X/.credentials.json` when directory
`X` holds `X`'s own login, and `<root>/.auto-switch.d/parked/X/.credentials.json`
when directory `X` is hosting another account. At any moment each account's
login is in exactly one of: its home slot, or one directory where it is live.

The swap holds two locks: the global lock `<root>/.auto-switch.d/lock`, and
Claude's own refresh lock `<live dir>/.oauth_refresh.lock`, taken with a
non-blocking `mkdir`. If either is busy, the swap is skipped until the next
update. The refresh lock is never broken, and is removed afterwards only if
it is still the one amplihack created (recovery also removes it after a
crash, using the inode recorded in the journal).

1. Finish any interrupted swap, then write `journal.json` and sync it.
2. Move `<live dir>/.credentials.json` to the outgoing account's home slot
   with `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)`. Sync both directories.
3. Move the target's home slot to `<live dir>/.credentials.json` the same way,
   set its modification time to now so Claude reloads it, and sync.
4. Update `ledger.json`, set `oauthAccount` in `<live dir>/.claude.json` to the
   target's saved block, delete the journal and sync.

Before each move the file must be a regular file owned by you with exactly
one hard link.

After a swap the wrapper writes one line to stderr (never to the status
line):

```
amplihack: profile "work" reached the auto-switch threshold; the session in profile "work" now uses the login of profile "personal"
```

If either move fails because the destination exists (`EEXIST`), a file is
where the state says none should be, and amplihack cannot tell which copy is
current. The swap stops at once: nothing else moves and nothing is rolled
back, so a move already done in step 2 stays done. The journal is kept with
`phase` set to `inconsistent`. Recovery never acts on an `inconsistent`
journal, so launches and logins of both profiles fail with
`AutoSwitchInvariant` until it is [repaired by hand](../howto/claude-profiles.md#recovery).

If the filesystem cannot do the move (`EXDEV`, `EINVAL`, `ENOSYS`), the swap
rolls back any move already done, deletes the journal, and disables swaps for
that directory; `status` says so. A login is never copied as a fallback.

#### `oauthAccount`

`oauthAccount` is the account name and organisation Claude shows in
`/status`. amplihack saves each profile's block to `accounts/<name>.json`
while that profile holds its own login. In step 4 it patches only that key
in `<live dir>/.claude.json`:

- the file is opened without following symlinks and read up to 32 MiB;
- if the file is missing, larger than that, a symlink, or not a JSON
  object, the patch is skipped silently and only the login moves;
- if no saved block exists for the incoming account, the patch is skipped
  with a warning that ends `/status may name the previous account`;
- if the saved block is damaged, the patch is skipped with the warning
  `auto-switch ignored damaged account details: <error>`;
- if `oauthAccount` already equals the saved block, nothing is written;
- otherwise the new content goes to a temp file in the same directory, which
  is synced and renamed over the file, keeping the file's existing mode; if
  that write fails, it warns `auto-switch could not update
  <dir>/.claude.json: <error>`;
- if the file changes while it is being patched (inode, size or mtime
  differ), it retries once and then skips with the warning
  `<dir>/.claude.json kept changing; account details not updated`.

`.credentials.json` decides which account is live; `oauthAccount` is only a
display. Claude keeps `.claude.json` in memory and rewrites it, so a write
by Claude can bring back the previous account's name in `/status` until
Claude next rewrites the file or the session restarts. Requests still use
the moved login. Other cached account fields are left alone.

### Leases

A directory is *live* when a process of yours, other than amplihack itself
and not a zombie, has a `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in `/proc/<pid>/environ` that
resolves to it. Relative values are resolved against that process's working
directory. A process whose environment cannot be read but whose command line
mentions `claude` or `amplihack` makes every hosted directory count as live.
Any doubt counts as live.

Account `X` is *leased* to directory `Y` when `Y` is not `X` and the ledger
says `X` is live in `Y`. These are refused before `claude` is spawned:

| Action | Refused when | Error |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Launch, `run` or `login` of profile `X` | `X` is leased elsewhere | `Leased` |
| Launch or `run` of profile `X` | directory `X` is hosting another account, unless the launch [joins](#joining-a-hosted-session) the session using it | `HostsForeignAccount` |
| `login X` | directory `X` is hosting another account (no exception) | `HostsForeignAccount` |
| `remove X` | `X` is in the ledger, has a parked login, or hosts another account | `Leased` or `HostsForeignAccount` |

#### Joining a hosted session

A launch *joins* the session in directory `X` only when all of these hold:

- the profile was inherited (tier 2 of
  [resolution](#resolution-and-environment)), not given by `--profile`,
  `profile run` or the default pointer;
- the launcher's own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set; and
- that value, canonicalised, is equal to the canonical path of `<root>/X`.

The comparison is between whole canonical paths. It never uses the value of
`AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE`, a profile name, or a string prefix. A fresh shell
that runs `export AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE=work` without the session's
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` does not join and is refused with `HostsForeignAccount`.

A launch that joins shares the session's current login. The checks run under
the global lock and again just before spawn.

Leases are interlocks against accidents. They are not a security boundary
against other processes running as you.

### Session end and recovery

These steps run at the start of every launch, `profile login`, wrapper run
and `auto-switch repair`, and when a launched Claude exits (before amplihack
exits, on success and on error). `auto-switch status` does not run them; it
only reports what they would do. They run whether the switch is on or off,
as long as `<root>/.auto-switch.d/` exists:

1. **Interrupted swap.** If `journal.json` exists, the state is worked out
   from which of the two known paths each login is at. If the incoming login
   has not reached the live directory, the swap is rolled back; if it has,
   step 4 of the swap is finished. A journal whose `phase` is `inconsistent`,
   or a layout that matches neither case, is reported as inconsistent and
   nothing is moved. Recovery replays forward or back by moving files; it
   never copies one.
2. **Return.** Every hosted directory that is no longer live (no running
   process of yours uses it; see [Leases](#leases)) is returned:
   the borrowed login goes back to its home slot, the owner's parked login
   goes back into its directory, the owner's `oauthAccount` is restored, and
   the ledger entry is removed. If the borrowed login is missing (for example
   after `/logout`), the owner's login is still returned.

A damaged, unknown-version or unknown-field `ledger.json` or `journal.json`
is never overwritten. Launches and logins for the profiles involved fail
with `AutoSwitchInvariant` and nothing is moved. The how-to's
[Recovery](../howto/claude-profiles.md#recovery) section explains how to
repair it by hand.

### Nested launches and auto-switch

Applies only when the switch is on and the profile was inherited
(tier 2 of [resolution](#resolution-and-environment)). An explicit
`--profile` and the default pointer are never redirected.

If the account live in the inherited directory is exhausted, the launch uses
the first eligible candidate that holds its own login at home and is not
hosting another account. The child gets `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE=<candidate>`
and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<root>/<candidate>`, the candidate gets the normal
pre-spawn check, and one line naming both profiles goes to stderr. Nested
launches never move logins. With no candidate, the inherited profile is used
as today. `--docker` and `--auto` are still refused with an inherited profile.

`multitask` workstreams apply the same choice to the `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE`
line their `run.sh` exports, and each nested launch checks again when it
starts.

### Usage-limit reruns

Applies when the switch is on, the profile was inherited, there is no
`--profile`, Claude's arguments contain `-p` or `--print`, and the launch is
not `--docker` or `--auto`. That is how recipe agent steps run.

The launch runs Claude under a supervising amplihack process:

- stderr streams live; its last 64 KiB is kept;
- stdout is written to a private temp file under
  `<root>/.auto-switch.d/rerun/` and printed once, after the final attempt;
- `SIGTERM` and `SIGHUP` are forwarded to the attempt; `SIGINT` reaches it
  through the terminal.

An attempt counts as hitting a usage limit only when all of these hold:

1. it was not killed by a signal;
2. it exited with a non-zero status; and
3. the recipe runner's own classifier, applied to the kept stderr tail
   followed by the last 64 KiB of buffered stdout, returns its
   `usage_limit` class. That is the same classifier, with the same markers
   (`session limit`, `usage limit`, `usage_limit_reached`, `quota exceeded`,
   `monthly limit`) and the same precedence, the runner uses to end a run
   with a usage-limit message. Work markers are checked first, then
   environmental ones, then usage-limit ones, so a tail that also matches a
   work or environmental marker is not a usage limit. For example, a
   `claude -p` stdout tail that contains `permission denied` anywhere is
   classed as environmental and the step is not rerun, even if it also says
   `usage limit`. Two usage-limit-like messages are environmental for the
   same reason and never cause a rerun: `credit balance is too low` (an
   environmental marker, checked first) and `disk quota exceeded` (which
   matches the environmental marker before `quota exceeded`).

Using one classifier means the supervisor and the runner cannot disagree: a
step the runner would end the run for is always offered a rerun first. A
false match costs one extra attempt, which is no worse than today's
termination.

The reset time comes from Claude's own message: if a line starts with
`Claude AI usage limit reached|` followed by digits, those digits are the
reset epoch. The last such line in the stderr tail is used, else the last in
the stdout tail. The text must start the line: a line such as
`model: Claude AI usage limit reached|1` does not supply a reset time.
Otherwise it is five hours from now. The
account's five-hour window is recorded as 100% used until that time, and
never later than five hours from now. A note naming both profiles goes to
stderr, and the step runs again under the next eligible profile. Each
remaining profile is tried at most once per step. When none is left, the
last attempt's output and exit code are passed back unchanged, and the
recipe runner reports the usage limit and ends the run as it does today.

Reruns happen at the step-launch layer: inside the nested
`amplihack claude -p` that each agent step runs. The recipe runner's retry
loop, its executor and its failure classifier are unchanged; the runner only
sees the final attempt.

The supervised attempt runs with `AMPLIHACK_AUTO_SWITCH_SUPERVISED=1`, which
stops it supervising itself; amplihack removes that variable before it starts
Claude. If the supervisor cannot start, the launch runs unsupervised, with a
warning.

The buffer is `rerun/<pid>-<n>.out`, where `<pid>` is the supervisor and `<n>`
the attempt. It is deleted when the attempt is rerun or its output has been
printed. If the supervisor is killed first, the next recovery run deletes the
buffer once no process with that `<pid>` is running, and any buffer older
than 24 hours regardless. Until then it holds whatever the step printed,
at mode `0600` in a `0700` directory.

A rerun starts the step again from the beginning, so anything the attempt
that hit the limit had already done (a commit, a push, a comment) may be done
again.

### State directory

Everything is under `<root>/.auto-switch.d/` (directories `0700`, files
`0600`). Profile names cannot start with `.`, so it never clashes with a
profile and never appears in `profile list`.

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `lock` | Global exclusive file lock for every ledger, journal, usage and login change. |
| `ledger.json` | `{"version":1,"hosts":{"<dir>":{"live":"<account>","swapped_at":<epoch>,"pre_swap_fingerprint":"<sha256 hex>"}}}`. `pre_swap_fingerprint` is `null` when there was no reading before the swap. Lists only directories hosting another account. |
| `journal.json` | The swap or return in progress: `op`, `dir`, `from`, `to`, `phase` (a step name, or `inconsistent` after `EEXIST`), plus `started_at` and `pid` for diagnosis. |
| `usage.json` | Readings, as shown in [Readings](#readings). |
| `parked/<name>/.credentials.json` | The home slot of a profile whose directory is hosting another account. |
| `accounts/<name>.json` | The profile's saved `oauthAccount` block. No tokens. |
| `statusline/<name>.json` | The profile's original `statusLine` object. |
| `rerun/` | Buffered stdout of supervised steps, `<pid>-<n>.out`; see [Usage-limit reruns](#usage-limit-reruns) for how long each is kept. |

Every state file has `"version": 1` and rejects unknown fields. State files
are capped at 64 KiB. Each name in them is checked with the
[name rules](#name-rules) before it is used in a path. A damaged
`accounts/` or `statusline/` file is ignored with a warning and not
overwritten.

Before any state write or login move, the root must be owned by you and not
writable by group or others (with the same private-group exception as
`install`), and every path must be inside the root, owned by
you and not a symlink.

### Platform support

| Platform | In-session swap | Nested substitution and reruns |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Linux, `/proc/self/environ` readable, login in `.credentials.json` | yes | yes |
| Linux where `/proc/self/environ` cannot be read (for example `hidepid`) | no; `status` says so and nothing is moved | yes |
| Other Unix (no `/proc`) | no; `status` says so and nothing is moved | yes |
| macOS with logins in the Keychain | no; no credentials file to move, skipped silently with a `status` note | yes |
| Windows and other non-Unix | no | no; every `auto-switch` command is refused with `AutoSwitchUnsupported`, and every other auto-switch path does nothing |

An in-session swap only happens when `<live dir>/.credentials.json` exists.
Moving a file is the only primitive that keeps one copy of a login, so there
is no fallback for other storage.

## Errors

Errors print one line to stderr as `error: <message>` plus `hint: <next step>`
and exit with status 1. Messages never include file contents.

| Condition | Hint |
|-----------|------|
| Invalid name | Lists the allowed pattern |
| Profile exists / not found | `amplihack profile list` |
| Symlinked or out-of-root profile | Remove the symlink and re-add |
| Pointer dangling (names a missing profile) | `amplihack profile switch <name>` |
| Pointer corrupt or oversized | Re-run `profile switch <name>` |
| `remove` without `--yes` | Re-run with `--yes` |
| `--profile` with `--docker`/`--auto` | Launch without the flag combination |
| Inherited `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` with `--docker`, `--auto` or env-activated Docker | `unset AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE and CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR to run with --docker/--auto` |
| Inherited `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` is an invalid name or not found | Unset `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE`, or create the profile with `amplihack profile add <name>` |
| Inherited `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE` names a profile that exists but cannot be used | The hint for the underlying cause, e.g. `check permissions on the profile root` for an I/O error or the `chmod go-rwx` hint for unsafe permissions |
| Recipe context key in the `AMPLIHACK_` namespace (`recipe run -c amplihack_…=…`) | Remove the key; the namespace is reserved |
| Invalid `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE_ROOT` | Use an absolute path |
| `Leased`: the profile's login is live in another profile's session | `` wait for that session to end, or run `amplihack profile auto-switch status` `` |
| `HostsForeignAccount`: the profile's directory holds another account's login | `` wait for that session to end, or run `amplihack profile auto-switch status` `` |
| `AutoSwitchConfig`: `.auto-switch` is a symlink or cannot be written | `` remove <root>/.auto-switch and run `amplihack profile auto-switch on` or `off` `` |
| `AutoSwitchUnsupported`: an `auto-switch` command on a platform without Unix file semantics | `auto-switch needs Linux or another Unix; leave it off` |
| `AutoSwitchInvariant`: the state files are damaged or a login is not where the state says | `see the Recovery section of docs/howto/claude-profiles.md` |
| `AutoSwitchInstall`: a profile's `settings.json` is a symlink, owned by someone else, not a JSON object, or cannot be written | `` fix or remove the reported file, then run `amplihack profile auto-switch repair` `` |

Auto-switch errors name profiles in the message; hints are fixed text. For
example:

```
error: profile "personal": its login is in use by a session in profile "work"
hint: wait for that session to end, or run `amplihack profile auto-switch status`
```

```
error: profile "work": its directory holds the login of profile "personal" for a running session
hint: wait for that session to end, or run `amplihack profile auto-switch status`
```

Auto-switch notes on stderr, errors and `status` contain only profile names,
paths relative to the root, phases, percentages and times. They never contain
token values, e-mail addresses or organisation IDs.

The inherited-profile message names `AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE`, shows the
value escaped (Rust `{:?}` form) and cut to 64 characters, and gives a fixed
reason: `invalid name`, `not found`, `refused path`, `unsafe permissions`,
`i/o error on profile root (<kind>)`, `not usable` or
`not applied with --docker, --auto or Docker`. `<kind>` is the I/O error
kind, such as `permission denied`; it never contains the value. For
example, as printed to stderr:

```
error: inherited AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE "work": not found
hint: unset AMPLIHACK_CLAUDE_PROFILE, or create the profile with `amplihack profile add <name>`
```

Control characters in the value are escaped, so a malformed value cannot
write terminal escape sequences.

## Security notes

When creating a profile amplihack reads the allowlisted assets and parses
`settings.json`; it never modifies the source directory and never copies
credential or history files. Allowlisted setting values and asset contents are
copied verbatim, so any secrets embedded in hooks, status-line commands or
skills remain the user's responsibility. Unix source reads are anchored to a
no-follow root descriptor; non-Unix platforms have a residual same-user
check-then-open race. Profiles are not a security boundary against the same
OS user.
The pre-spawn re-validation narrows but does not close the window between the
check and `exec`; it is not atomic. This is defense in depth: anyone who can
write the profile store already has the user's privileges.

Auto-switch moves `.credentials.json` files and nothing else touches them:
they are never opened, read, parsed, copied or refreshed. The only operations
on them are `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)` between two directories under the
root, `utimensat` (without following symlinks) to set the modification time,
metadata checks, and syncing the directories that contain them. Each account's
login is in exactly one place at any moment. `.claude.json` and
`settings.json` may contain secrets (`primaryApiKey`, `env`, `apiKeyHelper`):
only the `oauthAccount` key is copied out of `.claude.json`, rewrites of
`.claude.json` and `settings.json` keep the file's existing permission bits
(setuid, setgid and sticky are dropped; a new `settings.json` is `0600`), and parse errors report the path, line and
column only.
State directories are `0700` and state files `0600`, and symlinks are
refused, as for the profile store. Auto-switch
makes no network calls. The status-line wrapper runs the original command
with `sh -c`, which is what Claude itself does with it; the supervisor for
reruns starts amplihack directly with no shell.

Residual risks of auto-switch:

- Processes running as you, and root, are out of scope. They can read,
  move or replace every file involved, including the state directory and
  the saved status line; the ownership, mode and symlink checks stop
  accidents and other users, not them.
- Rerun buffers hold a step's stdout until the step finishes, or after a
  crash until the next recovery run (at most 24 hours); see
  [Usage-limit reruns](#usage-limit-reruns).
- A rerun repeats the whole step, including side effects of the attempt
  that hit its limit.
- The trigger is the runner's own text classifier. Output an agent was led
  to print (for example by prompt injection) can cost one extra attempt per
  profile, but only for a step that already failed with a non-zero exit and
  was not killed.
