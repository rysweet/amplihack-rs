# Workflow Issue Extraction (Step 03b)

> [Home](../index.md) > Reference > Workflow Issue Extraction

Reference for the three-tier issue-number extraction logic in
`default-workflow` step `03b`. This step resolves a GitHub issue number from
the workflow context so that downstream steps can link the working branch,
commit, and pull request to the correct issue.

## Overview

Step `03b` accepts a free-form `task_description` string (e.g. a copied GitHub
issue URL, a PR URL, or a plain-text description containing `#123`) and
produces a canonical `issue_number` integer that the rest of the workflow uses.

```
task_description  ──►  03b extraction  ──►  issue_number (int | null)
                                             branch_prefix
                                             issue_title (str | null)
```

If no issue number can be resolved, `issue_number` is `null` and the workflow
continues with an anonymous branch name.

---

## Three-Tier Extraction

The tiers are evaluated in order; the first match wins.

### Tier 1 — Direct issue URL

**Pattern**: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>`

When `task_description` contains a URL whose path component is
`/issues/<digits>`, the issue number is extracted directly from the URL without
any network call.

```
Input:  "Fix the crash described in https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs/issues/3960"
Match:  issues/3960
Output: issue_number=3960
```

This tier is purely regex-based and never calls `gh`.

---

### Tier 2 — Pull request URL

**Pattern**: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<N>`

When `task_description` contains a PR URL, step `03b` calls `gh pr view` to
retrieve the list of issues that the PR closes:

```bash
gh pr view <N> \
    --repo <owner>/<repo> \
    --json closingIssuesReferences \
    --jq '.closingIssuesReferences[0].number'
```

The first closing issue reference is used. If the PR closes no issues,
extraction falls through to Tier 3.

```
Input:  "Continue work on https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs/pull/4143"
gh call: closingIssuesReferences → [3960, 3983]
Output: issue_number=3960   (first reference)
```

**Timeout**: 60 seconds. If `gh` does not respond within the timeout, Tier 2
is skipped and extraction falls through to Tier 3.

---

### Tier 3 — Bare `#N` reference

**Pattern**: `#<digits>` anywhere in `task_description`

When neither a direct issue URL nor a PR URL is found, step `03b` scans
`task_description` for bare `#N` patterns. Each candidate is verified with:

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json url --jq '.url // ""'
```

The command returns the issue URL. If the URL path contains `/issues/`, the
candidate is accepted. Candidates that return an empty URL (non-existent or
wrong repo) are skipped.

```
Input:  "Resume work on #3983 and #3960"
gh verify 3983 → url: "https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs/issues/3983"
  → contains /issues/ → issue_number=3983
```

**Timeout**: 60 seconds per candidate.

If no candidate passes verification, `issue_number` is `null`.

## Output Contract

After step `03b` completes, the workflow context contains:

| Field          | Type          | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `issue_number` | `int \| null` | Resolved GitHub issue number, or `null` if unresolvable |

> **Planned enhancements**: `issue_title` (fetched from GitHub), `branch_prefix`
> (inferred from context), and `extraction_tier` (which tier produced the result)
> are targeted for a follow-up to improve debuggability.

### Example output (Tier 1)

```json
{
  "issue_number": 3960
}
```

### Example output (no match)

```json
{
  "issue_number": null
}
```

---

## Shell Security Constraints

Step `03b` follows the same shell-security rules as the rest of the default
workflow:

| Constraint                          | Detail                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **No `shell=True`**                 | All `gh` subprocess calls use a list-form argv; no shell interpolation                                                                                                         |
| **Heredoc delimiter single-quoted** | The `EOFISSUECREATION` delimiter in the issue-creation heredoc is always single-quoted (`'EOFISSUECREATION'`) to prevent shell metacharacter expansion from `task_description` |
| **60-second timeout**               | Every `gh` subprocess call carries `timeout=60`; hung subprocesses do not stall the workflow                                                                                   |
| **No credential logging**           | `gh` output is captured in memory and never written to disk unredacted                                                                                                         |

---

## Configuration

Step `03b` reads the following values from the workflow context:

| Context key           | Required | Description                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `task_description`    | Yes      | Free-form string describing the task                                       |
| `repo_path`           | Yes      | Absolute path used to derive `owner/repo` from `git remote get-url origin` |
| `expected_gh_account` | No       | If set, `gh api /user` is checked before Tier 2/3 network calls            |

No environment variables are specific to step `03b`; it relies on the
authenticated `gh` CLI configured in the user's shell.

## Examples

### Resolving from an issue URL

```yaml
# Recipe context snippet
task_description: |
  Fix path-traversal bug.
  See https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs/issues/3960
```

```
Tier 1 match: 3960
issue_number: 3960
```

---

### Resolving from a PR URL

```yaml
task_description: "Resume https://github.com/rysweet/amplihack-rs/pull/4143"
```

```
No issues/ URL found → Tier 2
gh pr view 4143 --json closingIssuesReferences
→ [3960, 3983]
issue_number: 3960
```

---

### Resolving from a bare `#N` pattern

```yaml
task_description: "Continue work on #3983"
```

```
No issues/ URL, no pull/ URL → Tier 3
gh issue view 3983 → url contains /issues/ → accepted
issue_number: 3983
```

---

### No resolvable issue

```yaml
task_description: "Refactor the config module for clarity"
```

```
No URL, no #N → issue_number: null
branch name falls back to slugified task_description
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**`gh: command not found`**

Install and authenticate the GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`.
Step `03b` degrades gracefully — Tier 1 (regex-only) still works without `gh`.

**Tier 2 returns no closing issues**

The PR may not use closing keywords (`Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`). Add a closing
keyword to the PR description, or supply the issue URL directly in
`task_description`.

**Tier 3 skips a valid issue number**

The issue may not exist in the repository that `gh` is authenticated against,
or the `gh issue view` call returned an empty URL. Check that the issue exists
and that `gh auth status` shows the correct account. Closed issues that are
still in the repository will also resolve successfully — verification is
URL-based (`*/issues/*`), not state-based.

**Tier 3 does not resolve a `#N` that is present**

The `#N` pattern requires at least one digit. Values like `#` alone or
`#abc` are not matched. Check that the issue exists in the resolved repository
and that `gh issue view <N>` returns a URL containing `/issues/`.
