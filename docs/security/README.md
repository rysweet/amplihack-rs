## Security Features Overview

### Token Sanitization (NEW)

Automatically detect and redact sensitive tokens from logs, errors, and debug output.

**Quick Start**:

```python
from amplihack.tracing.token_sanitizer import TokenSanitizer

sanitizer = TokenSanitizer()
safe_msg = sanitizer.sanitize("Token: gho_abc123xyz")
# Output: "Token: [REDACTED-GITHUB-TOKEN]"
```

**Supported Token Types**:

- GitHub tokens (gho*, ghp*, ghs*, ghu*, ghr\_)
- OpenAI API keys (sk-, sk-proj-)
- Anthropic API keys (sk-ant-)
- Bearer tokens
- JWT tokens
- Azure keys and connection strings

**Documentation**:

- [Token Sanitization Guide](./TOKEN_SANITIZATION_GUIDE.md) - Usage examples and patterns
- [Security API Reference](./SECURITY_API_REFERENCE.md) - Complete API documentation

### Model Validation (NEW)

Unified model validation preventing routing conflicts and injection attacks.

**Features**:

- Type checking and validation
- Format verification (alphanumeric + hyphens/dots)
- Path traversal prevention
- Length limits (200 chars max)
- ASCII-only enforcement

### Lock Session ID Sanitization (NEW in PR #4143)

Prevent path-traversal and metadata-injection attacks via unsanitized
`AMPLIHACK_SESSION_ID` values used in lock-file paths and metadata.

**Documentation**:

- [Lock Session ID Sanitization](./lock-session-id-sanitization.md) — sanitization rules, API reference, security invariants, and test coverage

---

### Input Validation (NEW)

Security-focused input validation for all external data.

**Features**:

- Model name validation (prevents injection)
- Length checks (reasonable limits)
- Character pattern validation
- Path traversal checks
- Newline/null byte detection

### Secure File Permissions (NEW)

Automatic secure permissions for sensitive files.

**Features**:

- Token files: 0600 (read/write owner only)
- Config directories: 0700 (rwx owner only)
- Automatic permission enforcement on save

**Implementation**: `save_token()` in `amplihack.security`

## Testing Security Features

How to test and validate security implementations:

- [Security Testing Guide](./SECURITY_TESTING_GUIDE.md) - Complete testing guide
- Test coverage requirements: 90% minimum for security code
- Testing pyramid: 60% unit, 30% integration, 10% E2E

**Run Security Tests**:

```bash
# All security tests
pytest tests/ -k "security or sanitiz" -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/ -k "security or sanitiz" \
  --cov=amplihack.tracing.token_sanitizer \
  --cov-fail-under=90
```

## Best Practices

Security principles and patterns:

- [Development Philosophy](../PHILOSOPHY.md) - Security-first thinking
- [Trust & Anti-Sycophancy](../../.claude/context/TRUST.md) - Honest, secure agent behavior
- [Workflow Enforcement](../workflow-enforcement.md) - Process security

### Quick Security Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] Tokens sanitized in all log output
- [ ] Input validation on all external data
- [ ] Secure file permissions (0600/0700)
- [ ] Model names validated
- [ ] Error messages sanitized
- [ ] Security tests pass (90% coverage)

## Security Issue Reporting

Found a security vulnerability? Report it:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security issues to: [security contact TBD]
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow 90 days for patch before disclosure

---

**Security First**: Always prioritize security over convenience. When in doubt, check [Security Recommendations](../SECURITY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md) first.

**New Features**: PR #1925 (Issue #1922) added comprehensive token sanitization, model validation, input validation, and secure file permissions. See documentation links above for complete details.
