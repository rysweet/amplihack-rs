# Amplihack Tutorial

**Comprehensive guide to mastering amplihack from basics to advanced topics**

---

## Overview

This tutorial provides a complete learning path through amplihack's capabilities, from your first workflow to building custom goal-seeking agents. Designed for 60-90 minutes of hands-on learning with progressive disclosure based on your skill level.

## How to Start the Tutorial

**The simplest way** — just type this in Claude Code:

```
"I want to learn amplihack - take me through the tutorial"
```

Claude will automatically invoke the guide agent and begin the tutorial.

**What's a "guide agent"?** Amplihack includes specialized AI agents for different tasks (building, reviewing, testing, etc.). The **guide agent** is one that's designed specifically for interactive teaching. You don't need to understand agents to use one — Claude handles the delegation.

**For advanced users** — you can invoke the guide agent directly using Claude Code's `Task()` tool (a built-in function that delegates work to specialized agents):

```bash
Task(subagent_type="guide", prompt="Start tutorial")
```

The guide agent will:

1. Assess your skill level
2. Tailor explanations to your experience
3. Provide platform-specific examples
4. Walk you through 7 comprehensive sections

## Troubleshooting

### Tutorial Won't Start

**Issue**: Guide agent not responding

**Solution**:

```bash
# Ensure you're in amplihack environment
amplihack --version

# Try explicit agent invocation
Task(subagent_type="guide", prompt="Start tutorial from Section 1")
```

### Navigation Not Working

**Issue**: Jumping to sections doesn't work

**Solution**: Use explicit section names in quotes:

```
"Take me to Section 3: Workflows Deep Dive"
```

### Can't Complete Exercises

**Issue**: Hands-on exercises fail

**Solution**:

- Check [Prerequisites](../reference/prerequisites.md)
- Verify API keys set
- Ensure Git and platform CLIs installed
