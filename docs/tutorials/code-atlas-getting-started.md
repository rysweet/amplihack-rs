# Getting Started with Code Atlas

**Time required:** 45–60 minutes
**What you'll learn:** How to build a complete 8-layer code atlas, read each layer, find your first structural bug using the three-pass bug hunt, and set up CI freshness detection.

**Prerequisites:**

- A repository with source code (Go, TypeScript, Python, .NET, or Rust)
- Claude Code with the amplihack plugin installed
- `git` available in your terminal

---

## Step 1: Build Your First Atlas

Open Claude Code in your repository and run:

```
Build a complete code atlas for this repository
```

The skill will:

1. Detect your language(s) from build files and entry points
2. Build 8 layers of architecture documentation
3. Run a 3-pass bug hunt
4. Save all outputs to `docs/atlas/`

**Expected output (first 12 lines):**

```
Analyzing codebase: /path/to/your-repo
Languages detected: Go, TypeScript
Services found: 3 (api-service, auth-service, worker)

Building Layer 1: Runtime Topology...
  Found: docker-compose.yml — 3 services, 2 external deps
  Output: docs/atlas/repo-surface/topology.mmd ✓

Building Layer 2: Compile-time Dependencies...
  Found: go.mod, package.json
  Output: docs/atlas/compile-deps/deps.mmd ✓
...
Building Layer 7: Service Component Architecture...
  api-service: 4 packages, 12 exported symbols
  Output: docs/atlas/service-components/api-service.mmd ✓

Building Layer 8: AST+LSP Symbol Bindings...
  Mode: static-approximation (no LSP server found — run /lsp-setup for verified results)
  Output: docs/atlas/ast-lsp-bindings/symbol-references.mmd ✓
```

The full build takes 3–8 minutes for a typical multi-service repository.

---

## Step 2: Read the Runtime Topology (Layer 1)

Open `docs/atlas/repo-surface/topology.mmd` or `topology.svg`.

This diagram shows:

- Every service (box shape)
- Every database and cache (cylinder shape)
- Every connection between them (labeled arrows)

**What to look for:** Are there services you didn't know existed? Are there connections that don't match your mental model?

**Example Layer 1 output:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph frontend["Frontend"]
        web["web-app :3000"]
    end
    subgraph backend["Backend"]
        api["api-service :8080"]
        auth["auth-service :8081"]
    end
    subgraph data["Data"]
        pg[("PostgreSQL :5432")]
        redis[("Redis :6379")]
    end

    web -->|HTTP/REST| api
    api -->|gRPC| auth
    api -->|SQL| pg
    api -->|cache| redis
    auth -->|SQL| pg
```

---

## Step 3: Check Your Route Inventory (Layer 3)

Open `docs/atlas/api-contracts/inventory.md`.

This table lists every HTTP route in your system:

```markdown
| Method | Path            | Handler                | Auth | Request DTO        | Response DTO     |
| ------ | --------------- | ---------------------- | ---- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| POST   | /api/auth/login | AuthController.login   | None | LoginRequest       | TokenResponse    |
| GET    | /api/users      | UserController.list    | JWT  | —                  | UserListResponse |
| POST   | /api/orders     | OrderController.create | JWT  | CreateOrderRequest | OrderResponse    |
```

**What to look for:**

- Routes with no auth that should require it
- Routes referencing DTOs that don't exist (bug!)
- Routes documented but no longer in the code

---

## Step 4: Find BUG-001 — The First Structural Bug

After the atlas builds, check `docs/atlas/bug-reports/`. You may already have a bug report.

Bug reports look like this:

````markdown
# Bug: POST /api/orders handler reads undeclared field

**Severity:** major
**Found in pass:** 1 (contradiction-hunt)
**Layers involved:** 3, 4

## Evidence

### Layer 3 truth: API Contracts

```go
// src/handlers/orders.go:47
customerId := req.Body.CustomerId  // accesses customerId
```
````

_Source: `src/handlers/orders.go:47`_

### Layer 4 truth: Data Flow

```go
// src/dtos/orders.go:12
type CreateOrderRequest struct {
    Items           []OrderItem `json:"items"`
    DeliveryAddress string      `json:"delivery_address"`
    // No customerId field
}
```

## Contradiction

Layer 3 handler reads `customerId`; Layer 4 DTO does not declare it.

## Recommendation

Add `CustomerId string` to `CreateOrderRequest` or remove the handler reference.

```

**This is a real structural bug** — the kind that causes silent TypeErrors in production.

---

## Step 5: Set Up CI Staleness Detection

Run:

```

Set up CI staleness detection for the code atlas

````

Or add the workflow manually:

```bash
# Copy the workflow file (already created by the skill)
cat .github/workflows/atlas-ci.yml
````

The CI workflow runs `scripts/check-atlas-staleness.sh` on every push and reports which layers need rebuilding.

**Test it locally:**

```bash
# Check if your atlas is stale after recent changes
bash scripts/check-atlas-staleness.sh

# Example output:
# Layer 3 STALE: API Contracts — triggered by: src/api/routes/user-routes.ts
#   Rebuild: /code-atlas rebuild layer3
#
# Summary: 1 layer(s) stale: [3]
# Run '/code-atlas rebuild all' to refresh the full atlas.
```

---

## Step 6 (Optional): Explore Layer 7 and Layer 8

**Layer 7** shows the internal anatomy of each service:

```bash
cat docs/atlas/service-components/api-service.mmd
```

Look for packages imported by many others within the same service — these are high-coupling candidates for refactoring.

**Layer 8** shows dead code and interface mismatches:

```bash
cat docs/atlas/ast-lsp-bindings/dead-code.md
```

Check which mode was used (line 1 of the README):

```bash
head -1 docs/atlas/ast-lsp-bindings/README.md
# **Mode:** static-approximation
```

To get LSP-verified results, run `/lsp-setup` first and then rebuild Layer 8:

```
/code-atlas layers=8
```

## What's Next

Now that you have a complete atlas:
